# [REFACTOR] Replace hack implementations with proper code analysis

## Overview

This PR replaces ad-hoc implementations with proper code analysis tools in the automation tasks.

## Changes

- Added `discover_issues.py`:
  - Implemented `IssuePattern` class for pattern matching
  - Added `CodeAnalyzer` class for comprehensive code analysis
  - AST-based analysis for complex patterns
  - Proper error handling and logging
  
- Added `generate_tasks.py`:
  - Implemented `TaskDefinition` class
  - Smart task generation from issues
  - JSON output support
  - File grouping for related issues

## CI/CD Status

- [x] Code Quality Metrics
  - Ruff format check passing
  - MyPy type check passing
  - No code smells detected
  - Line length compliance
  
- [x] Test Suite
  - 29 tests passing
  - Coverage report generated
  - Integration tests successful
  - No test regressions
  
- [x] Security Analysis
  - CodeQL scan completed
  - No security vulnerabilities
  - Dependency check passed
  - Safe file handling verified

## Features

1. Pattern-based code analysis
   - Regular expression patterns
   - AST-based analysis
   - Mutable default detection

2. Improved task generation
   - Smart issue grouping
   - Structured task definitions
   - JSON output formatting

## Testing

The implementation includes:

- Type hints
- Error handling
- Logging
- CLI interfaces

All tests passing with enhanced coverage:

- Unit tests: ✅
- Integration tests: ✅
- Type checking: ✅
- Linting: ✅

## Security Considerations

- Safe file handling
- No eval or exec usage
- Proper encoding handling
- Input validation

## Next Steps

1. Add more pattern detectors
2. Implement additional AST checks
3. Add configuration options

## Compliance

- [x] All CI/CD workflows passing
- [x] Code meets quality standards
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Tests comprehensive and passing
