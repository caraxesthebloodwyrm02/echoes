## Codebase Reorganization & Maintenance Complete

## Actions Performed

1. **Moved files to relevant folders:**
   - **logs/**: All security reports, bandit outputs, logs, test reports,
                 workflow reports
   - **maintenance/**: janitor.py, queensgambit.py, queensgambit_insights.json, symphony_orchestrator.py
   - **guides/**: 42CRUNCH guides, QUICK_START.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md, DOCKER_README.md
   - **automation/scripts/**: All PowerShell automation scripts (emergency-lockdown, framework_installer, etc.)
   - **tools/**: Utility scripts (code_quality_improvement, high_risk_task, review scripts, etc.)
   - **deployment/**: Docker and deployment scripts (deploy.py, docker-dev.ps1, Dockerfile.loadtest, etc.)
   - **security/**: Security monitoring scripts (security_monitoring.py, create-security-scripts.sh, etc.)
   - **testing/**: Test execution scripts (run_tests.sh, local_ci_simulate.sh)
   - **setup/**: Setup and environment scripts (42crunch-setup.ps1, fix-openapi-security.ps1, etc.)

2. **Updated documentation:**
   - **README.md**: Updated project structure section and usage examples to reference new folders and symphony orchestrator.
   - **docs/STRUCTURE.md**: Updated folder descriptions and added usage for symphony orchestrator.

3. **Ran full maintenance symphony:** Executed `python maintenance/symphony_orchestrator.py --full` to clean, secure, and report on the newly organized codebase.

## New Folder Structure

- `app/` — Main FastAPI application code
- `automation/` — Automation framework (security, cleanup, guardrails)
- `packages/` — Shared Python libraries (core, security, monitoring)
- `tests/` — Integration and unit tests
- `docs/` — Documentation and guides
- `maintenance/` — Maintenance scripts (janitor.py, queensgambit.py, symphony_orchestrator.py)
- `logs/` — Logs and reports from security scans, testing, and automation
- `guides/` — User guides, quick starts, and tutorials
- `tools/` — Utility scripts for code quality, automation, and reviews
- `deployment/` — Docker and deployment scripts
- `security/` — Security monitoring and sanitization scripts
- `testing/` — Test execution and CI simulation scripts
- `setup/` — Setup and environment scripts

## Usage Commands

- **Full maintenance symphony:** `python maintenance/symphony_orchestrator.py --full`
- **Individual tasks:** As documented in README.md and docs/STRUCTURE.md

The codebase is now fully organized, documented, and ready for scale and presentation. All files are in logical, relevant folders for easy navigation and maintenance.
