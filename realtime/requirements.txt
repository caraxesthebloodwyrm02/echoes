# Realtime Preview System - Requirements
# Pure Python implementation - no external dependencies required!
# Python 3.8+ required

# All functionality is implemented using Python standard library:
# - dataclasses (Python 3.7+)
# - typing (Python 3.5+)
# - pathlib (Python 3.4+)
# - json, time, logging, collections, enum, difflib, etc.

# Optional: For enhanced testing
# unittest (built-in)

# Optional: For future ML integration (not currently used)
# numpy>=1.20.0
# scikit-learn>=0.24.0

# Note: The system is designed to work with zero external dependencies
# This makes it lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy
