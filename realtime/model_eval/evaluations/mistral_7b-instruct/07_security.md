## Response

In this response, I'll provide a high-level design for end-to-end encryption in an offline-first application, covering the key aspects you mentioned. Let's call our hypothetical application OfflineApp.

1. **Key Management Strategy**
   - User-controlled private keys: Each user will generate and securely store their own private encryption/decryption key locally on their device using a hardware security module (HSM) or a secure enclave for enhanced protection.
   - Public key infrastructure (PKI): The application server will maintain the users' public keys for secure communication and data sharing. This way, the sender can encrypt data with the recipient's public key, while only the recipient can decrypt it using their private key.

2. **Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit**
   - Data Encrypted at Rest: Use symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) with a user-specific secret key to encrypt data stored on the device or in cloud storage (when online).
   - Data Encrypted in Transit: Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive information during data transfer.

3. **Handling Key Rotation**
   - Periodic key rotation can be implemented to reduce the risk of keys being compromised over time. Users should be notified when a key rotation event occurs, prompting them to update their local encryption keys securely.
   - Implement key revocation mechanisms to ensure that expired or compromised keys are no longer used in communication.

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Recovery phrases: Provide users with recovery phrases (e.g., mnemonic seeds) that can be used to restore their encryption keys in case of device loss, theft, or other emergencies. Implement best practices for secure storage and backup of these phrases.
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA): Mandate 2FA for critical operations such as generating or updating recovery phrases. This adds an additional layer of security to the application.

5. **Performance Implications**
   - Encryption and decryption processes can impact performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Implement efficient cryptographic libraries and caching mechanisms to mitigate these impacts.
   - Balance security and usability by minimizing the frequency of key updates and optimizing encryption/decryption algorithms for the target platform.

6. **Platform-specific Considerations**
   - Mobile devices: Leverage secure enclaves like Apple's Secure Enclave or Android's TrustZone to provide hardware-level security for private keys storage.
   - Desktop applications: Use OS APIs and libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, NaCl) to implement encryption and key management on various desktop platforms.
   - Web applications: Use browser-based APIs like Web Cryptography API (WebCrypto) to enable end-to-end encryption in the browser while maintaining compatibility across different platforms.
