## Response

In this response, I will provide a high-level design for implementing end-to-end encryption in an offline-first application, focusing on the key aspects you've mentioned:

1. Key Management Strategy:
   - Use a modern symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) with unique per-user keys for data encryption and asymmetric cryptography (RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography - ECC) to securely exchange these per-user keys.
   - Store the user's private key in a secure enclave or hardware security module (HSM). This protects the private key from being exposed even if the device is compromised.
   - Implement a Key Distribution Center (KDC) or use an external trusted third party to securely distribute and manage user keys while maintaining user privacy.

2. Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit:
   - For data in transit, use HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and servers. Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for securing network communications.
   - For data at rest, use the symmetric encryption key derived from user's private key to securely store the encrypted data on the device or offline storage.

3. Handling Key Rotation:
   - Periodically rotate keys to minimize the impact of compromised keys. When rotating keys, revoke the old key and generate a new one. Re-encrypt all existing data with the new key before discarding the old one.

4. Recovery Mechanisms:
   - Implement a secure backup process for user's private key. The user should have the ability to retrieve their private key if they lose access to it or migrate to another device.
   - Allow users to create a recovery phrase that can be used in case of lost access to both the data and the private key. The recovery phrase should be hashed, encrypted, and stored securely on the server. In case of emergency, the user can enter their recovery phrase to regain access to their data.

5. Performance Implications:
   - Use efficient encryption algorithms with fast key exchange protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange) to minimize performance impact.
   - Cache frequently accessed encrypted data for faster retrieval and use a combination of local and cloud storage depending on the user's needs.

6. Platform-specific Considerations:
   - For mobile platforms, consider using APIs provided by the platform (e.g., Android Keystore or iOS Keychain) to securely store keys and encrypted data.
   - For web platforms, use modern JavaScript cryptography libraries like `crypto-js` for implementing encryption and key management strategies in the browser.
   - For server-side implementations, leverage existing libraries such as NaCl (Naive Cryptography Library) to improve performance and security.
