# System Design: Versioning System

Design a versioning system for JSON documents that supports offline editing. Include:

1. Data structures for storing document versions
2. Algorithm for generating version identifiers
3. Approach to handling concurrent edits
4. Method for three-way merge during sync
5. Conflict detection and resolution strategy

Provide pseudo-code or Python examples for key operations.

```

## Response

For the versioning system, let's call it `JsonVersion`, I'll outline the design based on Git's approach but tailored for JSON documents and offline editing.

1. Data structures for storing document versions:
   - `Document` class representing a JSON object with an attribute `versions` that stores a dictionary of version ID to JSON objects.
   - `Version` class representing a specific version of the document, including a unique `version_id`, parent version (if any), and the actual JSON data.

```python
class Document:
    def __init__(self):
        self.versions = {}

class Version:
    def __init__(self, version_id, parent=None, json_data=None):
        self.version_id = version_id
        self.parent = parent
        self.json_data = json_data or {}
```

2. Algorithm for generating version identifiers:
   - Use a combination of timestamp and an auto-incrementing sequence number to ensure uniqueness when offline, e.g., `timestamp_millis + sequence`.

3. Approach to handling concurrent edits:
   - When saving a new version, first check if there's an existing version with the same parent; if so, it means there's a concurrent edit, and the user should be notified and asked to resolve conflicts.

4. Method for three-way merge during sync:
   - Use the `miniver` library (https://github.com/minimaxir/miniver) which is designed specifically for merging JSON objects. The library provides both simple and recursive merge strategies depending on the complexity of the JSON structure.

5. Conflict detection and resolution strategy:
   - Conflicts can be detected by comparing the changes made in concurrent versions (either manually or using a merge tool). If conflicts are found, users should be notified and asked to resolve them before merging the conflicting versions.
   - Resolution strategies could include manual intervention, automatic conflict resolution, or using machine learning algorithms to suggest solutions. However, these strategies are beyond the scope of this example.

Here's a simple example of how save and get operations might look:

```python
def save(document, json_data):
    parent = document.versions.keys()[-1] if document.versions else None
    new_version_id = generate_version_id()
    version = Version(new_version_id, parent, json_data)
    document.versions[new_version_id] = version
    return new_version_id

def get(document, version_id):
    if version_id not in document.versions:
        raise KeyError(f"Version {version_id} not found.")
    return document.versions[version_id].json_data
```
