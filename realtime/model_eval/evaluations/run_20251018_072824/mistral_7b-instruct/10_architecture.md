Title: Offline-First Plugin System for Extendable Applications

1. **Plugin Architecture Overview**
   The plugin system is designed to allow third-party developers to extend the functionality of our offline-first application without compromising data consistency. Each plugin will have its own namespace, making it easily manageable and isolatable from the core application.

2. **Lifecycle Management**
   Plugins follow the Application Lifecycle Management (ALCM) model, with key events such as `onLoad`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, and `onUnload`. Developers can create custom event listeners to handle these lifecycle events.

3. **Data Access Patterns**
   To ensure data consistency, plugins should communicate only through predefined APIs provided by the core application. For offline scenarios, plugins are encouraged to cache data locally and synchronize it with the core app when internet connectivity is restored.

4. **Security Model**
   Each plugin runs in a sandbox environment to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of core application data. Access control mechanisms are implemented at both the API level and the database level, ensuring that plugins can only interact with their own isolated data.

5. **Performance Considerations**
   To optimize performance, the plugin system should implement lazy loading, efficient caching strategies, and prioritize core app functions over those provided by plugins when resources are scarce. Additionally, plugins should be developed with a focus on lean code and minimal overhead.

6. **Example Implementation of a Simple Plugin**
   Let's consider a simple plugin that provides additional analytics functionality:

```javascript
class AnalyticsPlugin {
  constructor() {
    this._analyticsDatabase = null;
  }

  onLoad(coreApp) {
    this._coreApp = coreApp;

    // Initialize local database for storing analytics data
    this._analyticsDatabase = new SQL.Database('analytics');

    // Connect to analytics API when online
    if (navigator.onLine) {
      this._connectToAnalyticsAPI();
    }
  }

  onStart() {
    // Register event listener for user actions and save them locally in the analytics database
    this._coreApp.addEventListener('userAction', (eventData) => {
      this._saveUserAction(eventData);
    });
  }

  _connectToAnalyticsAPI() {
    // Implement connection to analytics API, sending stored local data, and fetching new configuration
    console.log("Connected to Analytics API");
  }

  _saveUserAction(eventData) {
    // Save the event data into the local analytics database
    const sql = `INSERT INTO user_actions (event_name, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?)`;
    this._analyticsDatabase.run(sql, [eventData.eventName, new Date().toISOString()]);
  }
}
```
In this example, the AnalyticsPlugin communicates only through the provided `userAction` event, saving data locally and sending it to the analytics API when online. The plugin runs in a sandbox environment and stores its data separately from that of the core app.

When considering offline scenarios, plugins should cache critical user actions locally and prioritize synchronization with the core application's database upon reconnection. This ensures consistent behavior and minimal impact on the user experience during temporary network interruptions.
