# Testing: Offline Functionality

Design a test suite for verifying offline functionality in a document editing application. Include:

1. Unit tests for core offline operations
2. Integration tests for sync behavior
3. How you would simulate:
   - Network latency
   - Complete offline scenarios
   - Intermittent connectivity
   - Server unavailability
4. Test data generation strategy
5. Performance testing approach

Provide example test cases in Python using a testing framework of your choice.

```

## Response

To design a comprehensive test suite for verifying offline functionality in a document editing application, I will use the pytest framework for Python. Here's an outline of how you can structure your tests:

1. Unit Tests for Core Offline Operations:
   - Test saving and loading documents locally when there is no internet connection.
   - Verify that changes made offline are saved correctly.
   - Ensure that document metadata, such as title, author, and creation/modification dates, can be saved and loaded properly during offline mode.

```python
def test_offline_save_load():
    # Save a document offline
    app.save("test_document.txt")
    # Load the same document in offline mode
    app.open("test_document.txt")

    # Check if the content matches the original one
    assert app.get_content() == load_example_data("test_document.txt")
```

2. Integration Tests for Sync Behavior:
   - Test that documents are synced correctly with the server when going online after being edited offline.
   - Verify that any conflicts during synchronization are handled gracefully, and the user is prompted to resolve them if necessary.

```python
def test_offline_sync():
    # Save a document offline and simulate going online
    app.save("test_document.txt")
    app.simulate_online()

    # Attempt to sync the document with the server
    app.sync()

    # Check if the content matches the updated one on the server
    assert app.get_content() == load_updated_data("test_document.txt")
```

3. Simulating Network Conditions:
   - Network latency can be simulated using libraries like `requests_mock`.
   - Complete offline scenarios are already covered in the unit tests since they test functionality without an internet connection.
   - Intermittent connectivity can be achieved by implementing a custom pytest fixture that controls the availability of network connections based on predefined rules.
   - Server unavailability can be simulated by returning specific HTTP error codes when making requests to the server during integration tests.

4. Test Data Generation Strategy:
   - Use Fixtures to generate test data before running each test case or group of related tests.
   - Store example and updated documents in separate files for better organization.

5. Performance Testing Approach:
   - Create test cases that load, edit, and save large documents to measure the application's performance under different offline conditions.
   - Compare the results with a predefined benchmark to ensure there are no significant drops in performance when working offline.

```python
def test_offline_performance():
    # Save a large document offline
    app.save("large_document.txt")
    start = time.time()

    # Load, edit, and save the large document several times
    for _ in range(10):
        app.open("large_document.txt")
        app.edit_content()
        app.save("large_document.txt")

    end = time.time()
    print(f"Time taken to perform 10 edits on a large document: {end - start}")
```
