# System Design: Versioning System

Design a versioning system for JSON documents that supports offline editing. Include:

1. Data structures for storing document versions
2. Algorithm for generating version identifiers
3. Approach to handling concurrent edits
4. Method for three-way merge during sync
5. Conflict detection and resolution strategy

Provide pseudo-code or Python examples for key operations.

```

## Response

For this system, I will design a simple yet scalable versioning system using Git's approach as a reference. The system will be implemented in Python.

1. Data structures: We will use a dictionary to store the JSON document and a list to keep track of versions. Each version object will have attributes for the JSON data, the timestamp, and the user who made the changes.

```python
class Version:
    def __init__(self, data, timestamp, user):
        self.data = data
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.user = user

class Document:
    def __init__(self):
        self.versions = []
        self.current_version = None

2. Algorithm for generating version identifiers: We will use a combination of timestamp and user identifier to create a unique version identifier for each version.

```python
def generate_identifier(timestamp, user):
    return f"{timestamp}_{user}"

3. Approach to handling concurrent edits: To handle concurrent edits, we will adopt the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach. This means that the last person who saves a version before a sync will have their changes applied and overwrite any conflicting changes made by other users.

4. Method for three-way merge during sync: During synchronization, we will perform a three-way merge between the local document (A), the server's latest version (B), and the client's last saved version (C). If there are no conflicts, we simply update the current version with B. If there are conflicts, we resolve them manually or by using a conflict resolution algorithm such as the Fast-Forward Merge Algorithm.

```python
def three_way_merge(A, B, C):
    merged = deepcopy(B)  # Start with the server's version

    for key in C:
        if key not in B or C[key] != B[key]:
            merged[key] = C[key]  # Merge any changes from the client's version that are not present in the server's version

    return merged

5. Conflict detection and resolution strategy: Since we are using LWW, conflicts will only occur during a sync when two users save conflicting changes to the same document. In this case, the system administrator or the user with editing rights can manually resolve the conflicts. For simple cases where the conflict can be easily resolved by merging changes (e.g., adding new fields without affecting existing ones), we can implement automatic conflict resolution using a custom conflict resolution algorithm.

Here's an example of key operations in Python:

```python
import datetime
from copy import deepcopy

document = Document()

# Saving a version
def save_version(data, user):
    timestamp = str(datetime.datetime.now())
    identifier = generate_identifier(timestamp, user)
    version = Version(data, timestamp, user)
    document.versions.append(version)
    if not document.current_version:
        document.current_version = version

# Syncing with the server and resolving conflicts
def sync():
    # Fetch latest version from the server
    remote_version = fetch_latest_version_from_server()

    if remote_version not in document.versions:
        # If there's a newer version on the server, update the current version and save it as a new version
        document.current_version = remote_version
        save_version(remote_version.data, 'server')
    else:
        # If there are conflicts during sync, manually resolve them or use a conflict resolution algorithm
        local_version = document.versions[-1]  # The client's last saved version
        merged_version = three_way_merge(document.current_version.data, remote_version.data, local_version.data)

        if merged_version != document.current_version.data:
            # If the merge results in a new version, update the current version and save it as a new version
            document.current_version = Version(merged_version, str(datetime.datetime.now()), 'resolved')
            save_version(merged_version, 'resolved')
```
