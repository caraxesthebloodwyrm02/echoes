## Response

In this response, I'll outline a high-level design for end-to-end encryption in an offline-first application, focusing on key management strategy, encryption at rest and in transit, key rotation, recovery mechanisms, performance implications, platform-specific considerations, and specific implementation details for the most critical components.

1. Key Management Strategy:
   - Use a well-established key management system such as OpenPGP or RSA OAEP with AES-256-CBC (RSA key length should be at least 4096 bits for security).
   - Implement Hierarchical Deterministic Key Derivation for handling multiple keys associated with a single user and ensuring secure backup and recovery.
   - Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud HSM to store private encryption keys securely.
   - Implement a client-side key management library like BIP32, BIP39, or Ed25519 for generating, managing, and storing user keys on the device.

2. Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit:
   - Use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption of data at rest. The ciphertext is authenticated during encryption to ensure data integrity.
   - Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 with forward secrecy and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) when transferring encrypted data over the internet. This ensures secure communication between clients and servers while ensuring that compromised private keys from previous sessions do not compromise future ones.

3. Handling Key Rotation:
   - Implement key rotation periodically to minimize the impact of compromised keys. The frequency will depend on factors like user risk level, criticality of data, and resources available.
   - Use a combination of full rotation (replacing all keys) and incremental rotation (updating a portion of keys) for efficient key management.
   - Store key rotation timestamps in the application to avoid rotating keys too frequently or too infrequently.

4. Recovery Mechanisms:
   - Use mnemonic phrases (BIP39) to store user private keys securely offline. Mnemonic phrases can be easily backed up and restored when needed.
   - Implement backup and restore functionality in the application, allowing users to create encrypted backups of their data and keys locally or on a cloud service with strong security measures.
   - Use zero-knowledge proof mechanisms like OTP (One Time Password) for secure password recovery if necessary.

5. Performance Implications:
   - Use efficient encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256-GCM) and avoid symmetric key sizes larger than 256 bits to minimize performance impact on the application.
   - Implement caching strategies to reduce the number of encryptions/decryptions when working with large datasets or frequent interactions.
   - Use optimized cryptographic libraries, such as NaCl, OpenSSL, or BoringSSL, to ensure fast and secure encryption.

6. Platform-specific Considerations:
   - iOS: Ensure compliance with Apple's security guidelines, such as using App Transport Security (ATS) for enforcing HTTPS connections and Data Protection Classes for data protection.
   - Android: Implement strong key storage mechanisms like Android Keystore or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to securely store keys on the device.
   - Cross-platform: Use a common cryptography library that supports multiple platforms, such as NaCl or Rust's Crypto API. Ensure that cross-platform communication is encrypted and authenticated using TLS 1.3 with PFS.
