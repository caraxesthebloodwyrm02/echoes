## Response

1. Core principles:
   - Operational Transformation (OT): This approach focuses on transforming operations to maintain consistency in a replicated system, allowing multiple users to edit the same data concurrently. OT algorithms convert local changes into equivalent sequences of edits that can be applied to other copies without conflicts. However, it can be complex due to handling merge conflicts and maintaining the order of operations.
   - Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): CRDTs are designed to enable conflict-free replication in distributed systems. They allow updates to a data structure that can be merged into any past state without the need for coordination or locking mechanisms. Each replica maintains its own version of the data, and conflicts are resolved by using reconciliation algorithms when merging changes from different replicas.

2. Implementation complexity:
   - OT generally requires more complex implementation due to managing conflicting operations, maintaining operation order, and dealing with potential inconsistencies. The OT library you choose can impact the complexity of your implementation.
   - CRDTs have a simpler implementation, as they eliminate the need for coordination between replicas, which reduces the complexity in conflict resolution. However, each data type (e.g., Counter, Set, Map) needs to be designed and implemented independently.

3. Performance characteristics:
   - OT's performance can degrade with increasing concurrency due to handling merge conflicts, particularly when there are many simultaneous edits.
   - CRDTs can provide better scalability and performance as they allow for conflict-free replication without the need for coordination or locking mechanisms. However, some CRDTs may have higher memory usage compared to traditional data structures due to maintaining multiple versions of the same data.

4. Use cases where each excels:
   - OT is well-suited for applications with a smaller number of concurrent users, where conflicts are rare or easily resolved. Examples include chat applications and real-time collaboration on simple documents (e.g., Google Docs in online mode).
   - CRDTs shine in highly distributed environments, such as IoT devices, sensor networks, or other systems with a large number of concurrent users or offline-first applications where connectivity is intermittent. Examples include etcd, Riak KV, and Codis.

5. Real-world examples:
   - OT examples: Google Docs (online mode), Etherpad, and Ace Editor's collaborative mode.
   - CRDT examples: Amazon DynamoDB Conflict-free Replica (CR) mechanism, Riak KV, Couchbase Sync Gateway, and Apache Cassandra's Tapir project.

6. Recommended choice for a document editing application with offline support:
   - For an offline-first document editing application, CRDTs are recommended due to their ability to handle disconnected operation and maintain consistency when reconnection occurs. Specifically, you could consider using a CRDT-based database like Riak KV or Couchbase Sync Gateway that support data types suitable for document editing, such as JSON documents with CRDT Set, Counter, and Map data types.

Edge cases: In both approaches, managing complex merge conflicts can be challenging. OT algorithms are designed to minimize conflicts but may still encounter edge cases where the conflict resolution is not ideal or may result in lost work or inconsistencies. CRDTs, while providing a simple approach for merging changes, may have difficulty handling certain edge cases, especially when data types need to be combined in unexpected ways. In such cases, additional logic may be required to address these complexities.
