# Testing: Offline Functionality

Design a test suite for verifying offline functionality in a document editing application. Include:

1. Unit tests for core offline operations
2. Integration tests for sync behavior
3. How you would simulate:
   - Network latency
   - Complete offline scenarios
   - Intermittent connectivity
   - Server unavailability
4. Test data generation strategy
5. Performance testing approach

Provide example test cases in Python using a testing framework of your choice.

```

## Response

To design a comprehensive test suite for verifying offline functionality in a document editing application, follow the steps below:

1. Unit Tests for Core Offline Operations:
   - Testing local file saving and loading operations (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting documents).
   - Ensuring that the data remains intact during the save-load process.

Here's an example using Python's unittest framework:

```python
import unittest
from document_editor import DocumentEditor

class TestDocumentOfflineOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.document = DocumentEditor()

    def test_save_load(self):
        # Create a sample document
        document = "Hello, World!"
        self.document.save_document("sample.txt", document)

        # Load the saved document and compare it with the original content
        loaded_document = self.document.load_document("sample.txt")
        self.assertEqual(loaded_document, document)

    ... (Add more test cases for various offline operations)
```

2. Integration Tests for Sync Behavior:
   - Testing how the application handles synchronization with a server when both online and offline.
   - Ensuring that changes saved locally are synced correctly once the internet connection is restored.

Example test case using Python's unittest framework:

```python
class TestDocumentSync(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.document = DocumentEditor()

    @unittest.mock.patch('mock_network.NetworkConnection')
    def test_sync_online(self, mock_network):
        # Simulate an online scenario
        mock_network.return_value.is_connected.return_value = True
        self.document.save_and_sync_document("sample.txt", "Hello, World!")
        mock_network().send_to_server.assert_called_with(...)

    ... (Add more test cases for various sync scenarios)
```

3. Simulating Network Conditions:
   - Network latency can be simulated using Python's `requests` library or the built-in `time` module to add delays during network requests.
   - Complete offline scenarios can be achieved by mocking a non-connected network connection (see example above).
   - Intermittent connectivity can be simulated by toggling between connected and disconnected states in your tests.
   - Server unavailability can be simulated by returning an error or time-out during requests to the server.

4. Test Data Generation Strategy:
   - Use a combination of hardcoded data (for specific test cases) and random data generators (e.g., Faker library for generating text documents).

5. Performance Testing Approach:
   - For performance testing, use Python's built-in `time` module to measure the time taken to execute certain operations such as saving, loading, or syncing a document. Compare these times under different network conditions and document editor states to ensure acceptable performance.

```python
def test_performance(self):
    # Generate some random data for testing
    data = generate_random_documents()

    # Measure the time taken to save multiple documents offline
    start_time = time.time()
    for document in data:
        self.document.save_document("temp.txt", document)
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Output the results
    print(f"Time taken to save {len(data)} documents offline: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```
