# Advanced Climate Modeling with Machine Learning

Develop an integrated climate modeling system combining physics-based models with ML:

1. Hybrid modeling approach combining GCMs with neural networks
2. Uncertainty quantification using ensemble methods and Bayesian neural networks
3. Multi-scale modeling from global circulation to local weather patterns
4. Incorporation of anthropogenic factors (emissions, land use, geoengineering)
5. Extreme event prediction using generative adversarial networks
6. Climate sensitivity analysis with causal inference techniques
7. Long-term projection capabilities extending to century timescales
8. Real-time adaptation and forecasting with streaming data integration

Provide detailed model architectures, training methodologies, validation strategies, and uncertainty quantification techniques. Include specific performance metrics, computational requirements, and pathways for improving climate prediction accuracy.
