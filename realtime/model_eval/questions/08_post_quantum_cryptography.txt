# Advanced Cryptography with Post-Quantum Security

Design a comprehensive cryptographic system resistant to quantum computing attacks:

1. Lattice-based cryptography implementation (Kyber, Dilithium) for key exchange and signatures
2. Multivariate cryptography for digital signatures with quantum resistance
3. Hash-based signatures (XMSS, LMS) for long-term security
4. Multivariate public key cryptography for encryption
5. Zero-knowledge proof systems with post-quantum security
6. Secure multi-party computation protocols quantum-resistant
7. Threshold cryptography for distributed trust models
8. Migration strategies from classical to post-quantum cryptography

Provide detailed cryptographic protocols, security proofs, implementation considerations, and performance analysis. Include specific parameter choices, security levels, and integration strategies for existing systems.
