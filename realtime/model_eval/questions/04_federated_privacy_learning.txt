# Federated Learning with Differential Privacy

Develop a comprehensive federated learning system with advanced privacy guarantees:

1. Implementation of differential privacy mechanisms (output perturbation, gradient clipping, noise addition)
2. Secure aggregation protocols resistant to various attack vectors
3. Client selection strategies optimizing for data heterogeneity and system efficiency
4. Handling of non-IID data distributions across clients
5. Robustness against poisoning attacks and Byzantine failures
6. Communication-efficient protocols minimizing bandwidth requirements
7. Fairness considerations ensuring equitable model performance across client groups
8. Scalability to millions of clients with varying computational capabilities

Provide detailed cryptographic protocols, mathematical privacy guarantees, system architecture diagrams, and performance analysis. Include specific privacy budgets, communication costs, and convergence guarantees.
