# Cognitive Architecture for AGI Development

Design a cognitive architecture for artificial general intelligence that integrates:

1. Hierarchical memory systems (sensory, episodic, semantic, procedural)
2. Multi-scale temporal processing (from milliseconds to years)
3. Emotional and motivational subsystems influencing decision making
4. Meta-cognitive capabilities for self-monitoring and self-improvement
5. Social cognition and theory of mind implementation
6. Creative problem-solving and analogical reasoning mechanisms
7. Ethical reasoning frameworks with value alignment capabilities
8. Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting

Provide detailed cognitive models, neural implementations, learning algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. Include mathematical formulations for cognitive processes, architectural diagrams, and pathways to AGI development.
