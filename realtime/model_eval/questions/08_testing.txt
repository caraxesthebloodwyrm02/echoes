2. Integration tests for sync behavior
3. How you would simulate:
   - Network latency
   - Complete offline scenarios
   - Intermittent connectivity
   - Server unavailability
4. Test data generation strategy
5. Performance testing approach

Provide example test cases in Python using a testing framework of your choice.
