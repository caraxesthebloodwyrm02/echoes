# Error Handling: Exponential Backoff

Write a Python function that implements exponential backoff with jitter for retrying failed API requests. Requirements:

1. Function signature: `def fetch_with_retry(url: str, max_retries: int = 5) -> Optional[dict]:`
2. Features:
   - Exponential backoff starting at 1 second
   - Full jitter for better distribution
   - Maximum retry limit
   - Logging of retry attempts
   - Proper exception handling
   - Timeout handling
   - Return None if all retries fail

Include type hints and docstrings.
