# Context Understanding

Please explain how you would implement an offline-first architecture for a middleware system that needs to handle intermittent connectivity. Focus specifically on:

1. Data synchronization strategies between local and remote storage
2. Conflict resolution approaches
3. Handling of failed operations when offline
4. State management during connectivity changes
5. Performance considerations

Provide a high-level overview first, then dive into the key components and their interactions.
