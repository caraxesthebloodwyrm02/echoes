# Quantum Algorithm Optimization

Develop a quantum algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem with the following constraints:

1. Implementation on a 100+ qubit quantum computer with current error rates
2. Hybrid quantum-classical approach combining variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with classical optimization
3. Error mitigation strategies for NISQ devices
4. Complexity analysis comparing to classical algorithms
5. Scalability analysis for increasing problem sizes
6. Practical implementation considerations including circuit depth and gate fidelities
7. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical solvers
8. Future improvements with fault-tolerant quantum computing

Provide detailed quantum circuit designs, mathematical formulations, and performance projections. Include specific qubit requirements, expected runtime improvements, and practical implementation challenges.
