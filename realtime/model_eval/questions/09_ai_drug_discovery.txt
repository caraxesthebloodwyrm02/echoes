# Advanced Drug Discovery with AI

Develop an AI-driven drug discovery platform integrating multiple methodologies:

1. Molecular generation using generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders
2. Molecular property prediction with graph neural networks and 3D convolutional networks
3. Protein-ligand interaction modeling with attention mechanisms and geometric deep learning
4. ADMET property prediction with multi-task learning approaches
5. De novo drug design with reinforcement learning optimization
6. High-throughput virtual screening using learned molecular representations
7. Synthetic accessibility prediction and retrosynthetic analysis
8. Clinical trial outcome prediction using multi-modal data integration

Provide detailed model architectures, training datasets, evaluation metrics, and validation strategies. Include specific case studies, computational requirements, and integration with existing pharmaceutical workflows.
