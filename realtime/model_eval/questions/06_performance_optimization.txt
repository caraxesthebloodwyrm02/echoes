# Performance Optimization: Storage Efficiency

What strategies would you implement to minimize the storage footprint of an offline cache for a document-based application? Consider:

1. Data compression techniques
2. Delta encoding for updates
3. Efficient indexing strategies
4. Garbage collection of stale data
5. Selective synchronization
6. Binary encoding formats

Provide specific implementation examples and discuss the trade-offs of each approach.
