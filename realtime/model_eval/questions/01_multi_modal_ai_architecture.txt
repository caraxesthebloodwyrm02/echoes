# Advanced Multi-Modal AI System Architecture

Design a comprehensive AI system that integrates multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video) with the following requirements:

1. Unified representation learning across all modalities using transformer-based architectures
2. Cross-modal attention mechanisms for understanding relationships between different data types
3. Efficient training strategies for large-scale multi-modal datasets
4. Real-time inference capabilities with sub-second latency
5. Robust handling of missing or corrupted modal inputs
6. Scalable deployment architecture supporting millions of concurrent users
7. Privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive multi-modal data
8. Continuous learning mechanisms for adapting to new modalities and tasks

Provide detailed technical specifications, mathematical formulations where relevant, and implementation considerations for each component. Include performance benchmarks and resource requirements.
