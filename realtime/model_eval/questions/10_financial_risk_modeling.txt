# Advanced Financial Risk Modeling

Design a comprehensive financial risk management system using advanced AI techniques:

1. Multi-asset risk modeling incorporating equities, bonds, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies
2. Extreme risk event prediction using generative models and anomaly detection
3. Market microstructure analysis with high-frequency trading data
4. Counterparty credit risk assessment using network analysis and graph neural networks
5. Systemic risk identification using complex network theory and contagion models
6. Real-time risk monitoring with streaming data processing and online learning
7. Regulatory compliance automation using natural language processing
8. Stress testing frameworks with scenario generation and impact analysis

Provide detailed model architectures, risk metrics, validation methodologies, and implementation strategies. Include specific regulatory requirements (Basel III, Dodd-Frank), computational architectures, and integration with existing financial systems.
