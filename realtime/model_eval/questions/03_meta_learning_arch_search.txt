# Advanced Neural Architecture Search with Meta-Learning

Design a meta-learning framework for automated neural architecture search that can:

1. Learn architectural patterns across multiple domains (vision, language, reinforcement learning)
2. Implement transfer learning between different task families
3. Use multi-objective optimization balancing accuracy, efficiency, and robustness
4. Incorporate domain-specific constraints and hardware targets
5. Enable few-shot architecture adaptation to new tasks
6. Provide uncertainty quantification for architecture recommendations
7. Scale to billion-parameter models while maintaining search efficiency
8. Integrate with existing deep learning frameworks

Provide mathematical formulations for the meta-learning objectives, detailed algorithm pseudocode, computational complexity analysis, and experimental design for validation. Include specific techniques for handling catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer.
