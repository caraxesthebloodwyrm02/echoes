# UX Design: Sync Status Communication

What UI/UX patterns would you implement to clearly communicate sync status and potential conflicts to users in an offline-first application? Consider:

1. Visual indicators for sync status
2. Conflict resolution interfaces
3. Offline mode notifications
4. Progress feedback for sync operations
5. Error messaging
6. User preferences for sync behavior

Provide mockups or detailed descriptions of key screens and interactions.
