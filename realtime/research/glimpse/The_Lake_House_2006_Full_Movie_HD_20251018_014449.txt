In my time Two years ago in New York time I was working in internal medicine in Madison Tell me about the future What's it like in year 2006?

Okay, here you go Very nice Nice It's not that I'm complaining I love my work And our tour through Chicago Opened my eyes to its beauty But my heart still misses the likehouse and it's trees. I miss those trees so much. I miss those trees. Don't worry Kate. We'll be together in time. We'll be together for far apart. Find a way to be close to you and take care of you. Get the greener! Take this. You should eat more. You do skinnier. Remember. How you used to eat when you were little. Yes, I remember. Did you or not write to each other? No, the carcable. Yes, to dad. What mom? Before your father. Yes? There was this boy. Did you love him? Yes. Why don't you marry him? So you could ask me this question some day. Look smaller. I've winded you completed it. You weren't born yet and I was eight. Blue ZA me to Frank Lloyd Wright. You know dad played cards with both of them. Let's share it a joint. Yeah, well. I can't swim. It should be a stairway down to the water. A porch, a deck. Here you're in a box. A glass box will be viewed to everything that's around you. But you can't touch it. No interconnection between you and what you're looking at. I don't know. You know, he's got this big maple grown right in the middle of the house. Containment. Containment and control. This house is about ownership, not connection. I mean, it's beautiful. It's a duck to be. But it's incomplete. It was all about him. Dad knew how to build a house, not a home. But you know, I think he wants us to do what he could. But admitting that. We mean admitting that he came up short in some way. That he could do more. And that torches him. Do you remember being here with mom? I remember she tried to make it work here. With us. With him. Hey, what about visionary Vanguard? What about it? Come on. You can't convince me you're going to be happy building these salt boxes for tourists. But what is going to admire you for that? Admire me for that. Yeah, visionary Vanguard. That's your idea. I can't. But you can keep the name. No, come on. It's got to be you and me. Henry, I'm sorry, I can't. I just, uh... What? I've got other plans. Do you have a girlfriend? No, no. What is that? You hesitated. No, I didn't hesitated. Come on, man. I don't have any time for that. What does time have to do with it? Oh, you're going to think I'm crazy. My dearest, Mr. Wiler, are you willing to play a game with me? Two years ago today, I was taking the 145 trained amadison from the Riverside station, and I forgot something there. It was a gift from my father. If you find it, can you please put it in the mailbox? It would mean a lot. Yours. Kate. Kate. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Final call. The number 546 is the man of choice. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. I'll call you. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. All the world. Kate, I found her. I have it with me. One day I'll get it to you. Trust me. I know how important it is to you. You might not remember, but we saw each other. At least I saw you. You never told me how beautiful you were. Well, maybe you saw somebody else. That was a bad hair year for me. Long brown hair. Gentle, unguarded eyes. Okay, okay, okay, okay. You saw me. But I still don't know what you look like. Well, why don't we just get together in the future and you can let me know what you think? It's a dead. Okay. Why don't you call me July 10th, 2006 at 9.05pm? I'm here. Hello? Kate? Yes? It's Morgan. Morgan. I'm here in Chicago. I came down for a meeting, but it was cancelled, so I thought you'd give your call. Have you eaten? No. I'm totally starving. We could grab a quick bite. Okay. All right. Looks pretty good. Oh. Perfect. No, Morgan. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Could you hold him for a moment? We'd love a table for two. The name? Oh, um, we don't have a reservation. I'm sorry, sir. I booked the October. October? Well, I'll get back to you. That went well. It's smoking for you. Oh, come on. Stop it. The best restaurant in town nobody gets a table here. No, it's not that. Oh, what is it? I didn't do this right. There wasn't a meeting. You saw me if there was no big deal. You know, coffee and coffee can turn into dinner. Dinner can turn into dinner. I'll admit. I do sometimes get a few steps ahead of myself. Morgan, few steps. You're always leaving 10 steps ahead. We were dating what a week. And you had our entire future map out there? Still, my residency you were thinking, you know, real estate. I would go to your house for the weekend. You'd have the entire town in your house to meet me. I do seem to remember that you made pretty fast friends with Morgan. What? You know what I've talked about. A guy? The guy I caught you making out with? What was it making out with him? What are we doing in high school right now? We followed them. A kiss? It was just one kiss with some random guy that just years ago. You know what? Unit 381 on Riviera States is complete. Cheers! Good job! One down? 44 to go. We're not terrifying when you're behind schedule just alarmingly. It's gonna be okay, the guys are getting another job. We could use another backhoe. And the wire on 14 needs to be resealed. Shut up. What? We're kinda disappointed in you. Why? Because you're supposed to be on top of things around here. I thought I was. You'd never notice these. Don't you remember you told me to get them? Right, right. Wow, not exactly what I had in mind, but... You like them? I like them. I think we should go out tonight. I'm not. Check. Check. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! Check! Check! Yeah! You're as I take it? Yeah, yeah, sorry, thanks. Come here, Jack. What were you thinking? How, girl? What were you thinking?

Thanks, Seth. Organ price. Alex, what? Hey, man, you need a hand with this? Yeah. What you want? There's a few months. I'm gonna play some of it. Well, like it, really. I can think of... Oh, man. Thank God he found him. Yeah. Mona. Morgan. Oh, hello. Did you meet you? I just made you two. Nice food, Seth. Listen, just so you don't think I'm gonna drink all this by myself. I'm having a bunch of friends over tonight for a party. You two are welcome to come. Mm-hmm. Oh, uh, hey, Alex. Take my card. I might be looking to run a place that'll link myself. Okay. It's Kate, my girlfriend. She's never really liked this place. I promised her we'd look for something new. Once she finishes a residency in Madison. So if you hear of anything... Sure, she's a doctor. Yeah. Alex. Great to meet you, Morgan. Great to meet you, all right. Hey, Morgan, what time's that party at? Made a clock? Kate's birthday. Come on, Jack. Oh, oh, oh, oh. One of us is changing. Or maybe we just stop trying. And it's too late, baby. Now it's too late. So we really did try to make it. Something inside has kind of lacking. Hide and adjust. Okay. Come on, get it. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. According to most accepted social norms, the person should not drink a little off the tantrum. Unless they have a good excuse. What's yours? Gosh, don't have one. I do. My youngest left for college this morning. Marie, one day she's splashing around and waiting for him diapers. Then she's packing up a board ball and driving to California. I just hope she knows what she's getting into. Don't tell me. Pre-med? Ingo. Hey, how are you? You see it? You're gonna meet some friends of mine. Alex, Marta? The Wuch? Susan? Johnny? Let's get you something to drink. Come on, back here. Far back here. Come on. Hey, this is Marjorie. Why didn't you mention it was today? We would have had a cake for you or something. It's just time passing. They're making a big deal out of it. You give a lot to yourself. Nothing wrong with it. But if sometimes when they're... What else you have in your life besides work? Family, boyfriend. Oh, I did. Once? His name was Morgan. Morgan? Morgan? Morgan? That's a sexy name. I'm not a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. I'm a sexy name. Okay, talk to you. I can't. Okay. This is Alex and Mona. This guy's gonna help us find our late house. Okay. You have an old chain. Anyway, well, I ended it. And I'm happy now and it was the right thing to do. So, oh, is it your right to... I couldn't help every time you hit a break at the hospital and you're writing something. There is someone. It's kind of a long-distance relationship. How did you meet? What? You know, a story of my life. You were kidding. Everything at a distance. Everyone. The man who was standing right in front of me, the one that wanted to marry me, him I pushed away, and I run from him. In the meantime, the... one man I can never meet. Him, I would like to give my whole heart to. He must write one hell of a letter. It's nice. It's safe. Christ, he's in prison, isn't he? No. You're one of those women, aren't you? Christ is the guy who's on a lake in the architect. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Happy birthday. Thank you. I hope it's a great year for you. I'm Alex. How's Guy? Oh, yeah. How you doing? May I? So you're going to... you're going to find us a place on the lake, huh? I hope so. Yeah. I can. You're a real estate agent? No. I just have a lake house. Oh. Is it nice? Yeah, you're loving. You're going to rent it after I move on. Really? Okay. Have you... read persuasion? What? By Jane Austen. I know, it's by. Yeah, it's um... It's my favorite book. Why did you bring something like that up? What made you bring that up? It's a friend of mine gave it to me recently and I was wondering... what's about. It's wonderful. Yeah. It's about... about waiting. It's two people they meet. They almost fall in love. But the timing isn't right. They have to part. And then years later they meet again and get another chance. You know, they don't know if too much time has passed. It waited too long. You know, too late to make it work. Why do you like that? I don't. No, don't get me wrong. It's beautiful when they cut that. It's terrible. It's terrible. That's... Yeah, it's terrible. It's a personal question. Have you ever been to anything like that? Me, no. When I was... when I was 16. I was completely in love with this guy. Like a guitar. I ran away from home and went to San Francisco so I could go live with him. Yeah, he convinced me I had a beautiful voice. I dreamed of becoming a singer. I love San Francisco. He was my first love. Probably the only one. You must have been a great guy. I don't know. You may have been. I didn't last long enough for me to find out. Truth is, I can't remember what he looked like. Really? Yeah. It was too bad. My dad showed up. Actually. Yeah, he treated me. He was in trouble. He yanked me back to Chicago. He was sick. He had these dreams of me becoming a doctor. You know? I want to mention, maybe he came my dream soon. He was right. You know, I feel good helping people. Any time? Okay. What? I, uh... You. I just... What? Do you know the song? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you sing? No. Nobody wants to hear me sing. You don't want to hear me sing. I, I didn't mean, you know. I, yeah. But I can dance. Now I see. This is the way it should be. For lovers, they shouldn't go in alone. It's not so good when you're on your own. So come to me. Now we can be what we want to be. I love you. Now I see. This is the way it should be. This is the way it should be. This is the way it should be. They shouldn't go in alone. It's not so good when you're on your own. I'm very sure this never happened to be before. I met you, but now I'm sure. This never happened before. This never happened before. This never happened before. This never happened before. This never happened before. This never happened before. Okay. Hey. Alex was just telling me about the, um, the lake house. Yeah, it sounds really great. Great. Alex, it's late. Yeah. Good night. It was you. Why didn't you say anything? I would have thought I was crazy, drunk, or both. Yeah, but I liked you. You should have said something. How? You were with your boyfriend. You know what? Excuse me, excuse me. You are a coward. I'm not a coward. Oh, really? Well, what about your girlfriend? What? I told you already she's not my girlfriend. She's not my boyfriend. Oh, really? Well, what does he have? Your brother? Ah, you have a comedian. What do you have? A clown for breakfast this morning? Wonderful, our first fight. You could write a song about it and go sing it in San Francisco. What? Hello? Hey, Henry. What? Hi. Good afternoon. Looking for my father, I don't know which room he's in. Simon Wiler? Mr. Wiler, do you want to take it? Yes. I'm Anna Krizinski. I'm the attending for your father. What happened? How is it? He's okay. He's had a heart attack. Fortunately, relatively minor. His vitals are fine and his stable. But it will require an intervention. Is it great to schedule it for tomorrow? Good to see you're taking it easy. Well, you didn't need to come. I'm perfectly well. Perfect, all right. Yeah, had a heart attack, dad. I had an episode for Christ's sake. Nothing more. I appreciate it. You kept everything in its perspective. Let me just want to let you know I'm here if you need anything. Coffee. What? You heard me. Coffee. There's something I never told you came. You see, it was my father who built the lake house. I mean, with his own hands. It was a long time ago before he was famous when he still had a family and worshiped my mother. Her name was Mary, and the house was a gift for her. She was smart and funny. She could have done anything, but chose to take care of my brother and I, and help him build his career. You see, the more successfully became the more impossible he was to live with. Finally, she just couldn't take living with him anymore. She left him. Within a year, she got sick. Unfortunately, she never learned how to stop loving him. He wasn't at the funeral. When I asked him why. Come on, Alex, what did he say? He said she was dead to me the moment she stepped out of the house. And then he gave me one of his architecturally year grins. I hope you appreciate this. I'd have sneak past three nurses in your attending. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's not decapital. It should be, but it isn't. Well, that's not bad. Thank you. Son. You're welcome. Where's your brother? I sent him away. He wasn't feeling well. You know how he is, he worries. Yeah, you can send from your mother. I'm afraid she always worried too much. When are you looking at him? Oh, yeah, he takes a gander. It's a proposal for a museum. Who is it? Don't someone new? I like the walkways. Where the light falls. Where are the materials? Ground it, one in a minute. White panels are straight out of the wire, but the interior color coming through the front window, since different. It's not new, but it's clean and cluttered. I like it. When was the last time you were in Barcelona? Years ago with you, mom and Henry. Do you remember visiting Kazajura Karita? The old-south. That's right. You mentioned Meyer. His Barcelona Museum stands in the same area as Kazajura Karita. It drinks the same light. Meyer designed a series of louvered skylights to capture that light and cast it inward to illuminate the art within. But indirectly, and that was important, because although light enhances art, it can also degrade it. But you know that already. Now this. When do you suppose this is meant to be built? I have no idea. Oh, but you said you might. Conceptually. Come on. You know as well as I do that the light in Barcelona is quite different from the light in Tokyo. And the light in Tokyo is different from that in Prague. A truly great structure. One that is meant to stand the tests of time, never disregards this environment. A serious architect takes that into account. He knows that if he wants presents, he must consult with nature. He must be captivated by the light. Always the light. Always. Hey, I have an emergency. Take my shift. Please. Hello? Mr. Wiley. Yes? This is Dr. Clizinski at Chicago City Hospital. I am afraid I have some difficult news for you. I'm so sorry, Alex. I wish somehow I could be there with you. That we could sit together and look out over the water in the light in this house your father built. I could be a shoulder for you like you've been for me and tell you that everything is going to be okay. If I could do one thing for you today, from here, one small simple thing from the future. I hope this is it. It won't be published for a couple of years, but I don't think you should have to wait that long. I hope it helps you know how much you were loved. Oh. I'm sorry. Pick a place. I'll be there. Promise. Tomorrow, what do you say? But Alex, it will be tomorrow for you. You're going to have to wait. I know. I don't care. I'll wait. Are you sure? I don't know. I do. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. Okay. I'll see you in two years. I'll see you tomorrow, man. Kate. Where would you like to go? Oh, Mari. I'm where you would be to die with us. Two years from tomorrow. Two years from tomorrow. Two years. From tomorrow. Hi. Hello. Name? Forrester. Can I have your name? Wailer. Or, uh, Wailer. I'm really not sure. I think we should be able to accommodate you, sir. Great. Wailer. Wailer. You're way to early right with you. Wailer. Wailer. Wailer. Wailer. Wailer. Wailer. Wailer. Good evening, miss. Complementing. Good luck. They won't thrill me like yours used to be. Good luck. Another glass for the lady? What? You're here. And more than well, I wish you love. I wish you shelter from the storm. A cozy fire to keep you warm. But most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you... When snowflakes fall, I wish you love. You weren't there. You didn't come. I understand. Something must have happened. I'm sorry. I've got two years, Kate. We can try again. No, Alex. It's too late. It already happened. It didn't work. Don't give up on me, Kate. What about persuasion? You told me they wait. They meet again. They have another chance. Life is not a book, Alex. And it can be over in a second. I was having lunch with my mother at Daily Plaza. And a man was killed right in front of me. He died in my arms. And I thought... It can end just like that on Valentine's Day. And I thought about all the people who love him waiting at home who will never see him again. And then I thought, what if there is no one? What if you live your whole life and no one is waiting? So I drove to the lake house looking for any kind of answer. And I found you. And I let myself get lost. Lost in this beautiful fantasy where time stood still. But it's not real, Alex. I have to learn to live the life that I have got. He's don't write anymore. Don't try to find me. Let me let you go. Let me let you go. I'm sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? You're fine today. Come on. Come on. How long are you here? A lighter bar with some friends. And you're born on your own. This is good. And it was really good to hear your voice. I was surprised how good it was to hear your voice. So how was your meeting? Good. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got the job. Really? Yeah. Congratulations. I can't imagine that. You can't imagine that. Yeah. Telecom company. I'll be in House Counsel and pay as well. And it's here. In Chicago? Well, it's great news. What? See you there. Okay. Alright. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Sorry. Next week, I bet you'll like it. I can do it. Again, my Victoria! And you see this? I'm gonna come down this weekend. Don't you miss me a little bit? Not just a little bit, not a lot. Okay. Now I heard you. Yeah. Okay. Um, can I just go back to the hotel? Yeah. Now I heard you. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna have to call you back. Okay. Still want to rent a lake house? It's what Kate wants. How the hell do you know what Kate wants? Trust me. Are you? Are you? Yeah, it's not worth a day. What do you think? You're fixing, you know? Why do you keep tweaking the lake house? Why don't you do your own work? Because it's hers. You're uh, talking about the girl from the future. Kate. You're still riding with Kate? No. Why not? She asked me not to. Why? Time. Hey, come on. This is a good thing. You know, you need a real woman. A woman? Hey, me. Listen. Listen to me. Well, it lasted. She was more real to me than any of that stuff. She was more real to me than anything I've ever known. I saw her. I kissed her. I love her. And now she's gone. She's gone. Well, and that got squirt through. First thing. How could the abs do their full minute abs sheets? And your potatoes cooking on the top. It's nice out here. That's the end. You have to eat. Well, you need to eat it. I'll cook. I thought you didn't like it, Kate. No, I don't like it. But I have a chicken and the ice box, and you're eating it. I'm not over washing up now. Really? Did you turn that town a little bit? It's a little easy place. Fun for you and one for you. I will. I will. It could have been not too hard so open. No taste so similar. No feeling so envious. One more time. One two three go come here. Come in. Hello? Voyage. What do you think? This is what I gave up lunch for. I know it needs work. Work? What a wrecking ball. Found an architect who specializes in renovations. A department for tomorrow. Ampush. Come on. I can't stay in my apartment. We've been there over a year. Don't keep looking forward. What I really don't know, 21 hours. Is that good? It was a time. It was a new firm. New is an experience? No, it was a cheat. So... What's up, Footprints? Hi, Doctor. He's with the phone. Oh, by the way. Don't be Valentine's Day. Oh, God, Katie. I didn't get you anything. I just been... so swamped. Whoa! What is this? Global warming. Doctor Forster? So leave the way. Is it making it be? What you really don't want to be? Leave the way. Is it making it love? What you really don't want to be? I'm not gonna lie. I'm trying to see you get you to your wealth. Good morning. Hey, we're in the nest. I've got it back. Wow. What you see... is what we're talking about. Wow, that's stunning. So we were able to do it with all the glass panels in the metal smash. Hey, you want to get a beer after work? Sorry. I can't. I'm taking Vanessa out for Valentine's Day. Wait. Say that again. Valentine's Day today. Taking out Vanessa. campaigns, the moister, the little chocolate. It's a day. February 14th.

I get to get back to work. You did this drawing? My brother did, actually. Who's your brother? Alex Weiler. Did you know him? Yeah. Yeah, I know. Do you know how I can get in touch with him? Is he anywhere that I can come? I'm sorry. He died two years ago today, actually. There was an accident. Where? OK. Wait, just stop. Just stop. I can't even answer me. What's the matter? OK. OK. OK. OK. 60 degrees on Valentine's Day. This cannot be Chicago. The TV says it's global warming. Nothing wrong with that. It's a dangerous thing. Alex, I know why you didn't show up that night. It was you a daily class of that day. It was you. Please don't go. Just wait. Please don't look for me. Don't try to find me. I love you. And it's taking me all this time to say it. But I love you. And if you still care for me, wait for me. Wait with me. Just wait. Wait. Wait two years, Alex. Come to the lake house. I'm here. Are you some good time? He waited. He waited. It's starting now.

[05:22 - 05:24] Are you crazy?
[05:24 - 05:27] Why would you take that house, Alex?
[05:27 - 05:30] It's made of glass, there's no privacy

[09:20 - 09:22] Holding his books
[09:22 - 09:25] I feel like he's with me somehow
[09:25 - 09:28] Knowing that he was once on the same pages
[09:28 - 09:31] Preeding the same words
[09:40 - 09:42] I'm going to be lent a daily clause

[10:16 - 10:19] Callie, Carlos, Frank, Danny, much his name
[10:19 - 10:20] Talkin
[10:20 - 10:21] Raphael
[10:21 - 10:23] Raphael
[10:23 - 10:24] Let's go
[10:24 - 10:26] Okay
[10:29 - 10:31] Hey
[10:40 - 10:42] Hey
[10:45 - 10:48] I heard about daily clause
[10:48 - 10:52] EMT has said you fought hard with a guy
[10:52 - 10:55] Yep, really knocked myself out
[10:55 - 11:00] Kate, I'm going to tell you what I tell every young doctor
[11:00 - 11:03] Hopefully it will be the first to listen
[11:03 - 11:06] On your day off
[11:07 - 11:10] Get us four away from this place as you can
[11:10 - 11:13] Go someplace where you feel
[11:13 - 11:15] Most like yourself
[11:36 - 11:39] You know
[12:07 - 12:11] Dear Miss Forster
[12:11 - 12:14] I got your note
[12:14 - 12:17] And I'm afraid there must be some kind of misunderstanding
[12:17 - 12:21] As far as I know, the lake house has been empty for several years
[12:21 - 12:25] Maybe your note was intended for the Sandberg house down the shore
[12:25 - 12:28] Since no one has lived in this house for years
[12:28 - 12:32] But I'm curious about the paw prints
[12:37 - 12:40] Dear Mr. Wiler
[12:40 - 12:45] I'm very familiar with the Sandberg cottage and I can guarantee I never lived there
[12:45 - 12:49] I'm old fashioned but I don't think a cottage should be over 6,000 square feet
[12:49 - 12:51] So, let me try again
[12:51 - 12:53] I used to live at the lake house
[12:53 - 12:54] Then I moved
[12:54 - 12:58] Now I live at 1620 North for scene in Chicago
[12:58 - 13:01] I'd appreciate it if you would forward my mail if you get any
[13:01 - 13:03] Oh, by the way
[13:03 - 13:05] It's 2006
[13:06 - 13:08] Has been all year ask anyone
[13:08 - 13:11] 2006
[13:11 - 13:12] Myth
[13:12 - 13:13] May
[13:13 - 13:14] 2006
[13:14 - 13:15] Oh
[13:15 - 13:17] Oh
[13:17 - 13:18] Oh
[13:18 - 13:19] Oh
[13:19 - 13:20] Good
[13:20 - 13:22] Morning Mr. Wiler
[13:22 - 13:23] Morning Mr. Wiler
[13:23 - 13:24] Morning
[13:24 - 13:25] Morning
[13:25 - 13:27] Morning Mr. Wiler
[13:27 - 13:28] Mr. Wiler
[13:28 - 13:31] Sir
[13:31 - 13:40] Well, obviously I derive my inspiration for the metaphor of the fugue, the loop
[14:02 - 14:04] It's just hours of that shit
[14:04 - 14:07] You did me
[14:07 - 14:10] I'm not talking about you, it's the distant, bitter, bitter old man
[14:10 - 14:12] I think I've been a little over dramatic
[14:18 - 14:21] Where are you going?
[14:21 - 14:24] You guys are bonkers
[14:25 - 14:27] You must have been a little over the past
[14:30 - 14:32] I'm not talking about you, I'm not talking about you
[14:32 - 14:34] I'm not talking about you, I'm not talking about you
[14:34 - 14:37] I can't believe that thing's still running
[14:40 - 14:41] Yep
[14:44 - 14:46] It looked like shit
[14:46 - 14:51] I can't believe that thing's still running
[14:51 - 14:54] I can't believe that thing's still running
[14:54 - 14:56] Yep
[14:58 - 15:00] It looked like shit
[15:00 - 15:02] It looked like shit
[15:02 - 15:04] It looked like shit
[15:04 - 15:06] I missed you too
[15:25 - 15:27] Hey, forget about it
[15:33 - 15:34] We're here
[15:34 - 15:35] You're joking
[15:35 - 15:38] I don't believe this, I come back after four years
[15:38 - 15:40] And I get this in front of me
[15:40 - 15:41] What?
[15:41 - 15:43] My little brother thinking he's Frank Lloyd, whatever
[15:43 - 15:44] Oh, come on
[15:44 - 15:47] Dad keeps you honest, he's not a miss-making factory at his
[15:47 - 15:51] He's still having built so much as a telephone booth or a hamster cave
[15:51 - 15:53] It's funny, you say that actually
[15:53 - 15:56] I have a hamster cage in mind, a development of them actually
[15:56 - 15:59] Free fab, no foundations, anything about that
[15:59 - 16:01] See? That's what I'm talking about
[16:01 - 16:03] You have vision
[16:03 - 16:05] Uh, speaking of which
[16:05 - 16:07] I'd like you to know
[16:07 - 16:09] I bought a house
[16:09 - 16:10] Where?
[16:10 - 16:12] On the lake
[16:12 - 16:14] You bought a lake house, so you are making somebody
[16:14 - 16:16] Well, it's a dump and abandoned for years
[16:16 - 16:19] Oh, so you got an abandoned haunted lake house?
[16:19 - 16:24] Yeah, that's a good reason there's any for selling out and joining the Flabby developer's guild
[16:24 - 16:25] How about this?
[16:25 - 16:26] I even got a dog
[16:26 - 16:27] You got a dog
[16:27 - 16:30] You just showed up at that house
[16:30 - 16:32] Not in a way
[16:45 - 16:46] What are we doing here?
[16:46 - 16:48] I have to deliver a letter
[16:48 - 16:49] You should be here
[16:49 - 16:52] 1620 North Rec
[16:52 - 16:59] I'm not thinking of a number of books
[16:59 - 17:01] There's nothing here
[17:01 - 17:04] Are we meeting someone to somebody live here?
[17:04 - 17:05] What?
[17:05 - 17:07] Yeah
[17:07 - 17:09] I thought so
[17:09 - 17:12] Should we ring the bell?
[17:30 - 17:32] Dear Ms. Forster
[17:32 - 17:35] I went to 1620 North Rec
[17:35 - 17:37] And it's not there
[17:37 - 17:39] It's just a construction site
[17:39 - 17:43] From the pictures it looks nice, but not for another 18 months
[17:43 - 17:45] What am I missing here?
[17:45 - 17:47] Maybe you got the address wrong
[17:47 - 17:49] Because I noticed you got the date wrong too
[17:49 - 17:52] You really want to play this game?
[17:52 - 17:57] If you are really in here, 2000 and so on
[17:59 - 18:01] I don't know
[18:03 - 18:05] Before I learned
[18:07 - 18:09] Where were that day?
[18:09 - 18:10] You're not happy
[18:10 - 18:12] I'm in it
[18:12 - 18:14] I know
[18:14 - 18:18] Okay, my mystery correspondent, I get it
[18:18 - 18:21] Just in case you really are wearing when you think you are
[18:21 - 18:23] You'll need this
[18:23 - 18:27] There was a free plate snow that spring and everyone got sick
[18:27 - 18:31] So, plenty of rest, lots of fluids
[18:31 - 18:33] Doctors orders
[18:33 - 18:35] Snow, right
[18:40 - 18:42] Come to the popper
[18:57 - 19:00] Ersa
[19:58 - 20:00] Jack
[20:21 - 20:23] Jack
[20:23 - 20:26] Jack, come on girl, come on, come on
[20:26 - 20:28] Jack
[20:57 - 20:59] Jack, come on
[21:13 - 21:16] Impossible, I know, not possible
[21:16 - 21:18] But it's happening
[21:27 - 21:29] Okay
[21:35 - 21:37] Where am I?
[21:45 - 21:47] Lake House
[21:47 - 21:49] Lake House
[21:49 - 21:51] Yes, well as you can see I too am at the lake house
[21:51 - 21:53] But I'm getting a little tired of these games
[21:53 - 21:54] So I'm going to be leaving
[21:54 - 21:56] Bye, thank you, bye
[21:58 - 22:01] Maybe we should introduce ourselves properly
[22:06 - 22:10] I'm a doctor dedicated to curing the sick
[22:10 - 22:12] At least trying to
[22:13 - 22:16] I'm an architect, I like to build
[22:16 - 22:19] And while I wouldn't see my current project as ideal
[22:19 - 22:22] It allows me to be here in this place
[22:22 - 22:24] And that's enough for now
[22:24 - 22:26] But tell me something
[22:26 - 22:29] If you're working in a hospital in Chicago now
[22:29 - 22:30] Where were you before?
[22:30 - 22:32] In my time
[22:32 - 22:34] Two years ago in New York time
[22:34 - 22:38] I was working in internal medicine in Madison
[22:41 - 22:43] Tell me about the future
[22:43 - 22:46] What's it like in year 2006?
[22:46 - 22:50] I'm afraid the world's pretty much the same
[22:52 - 22:56] Of course we all dress in shiny metal jumpsuits and dry flying cars
[22:56 - 23:00] And no one talks anymore because we can read each other's minds
[23:00 - 23:03] But the truth is, man, from the past
[23:03 - 23:06] Not much has really changed in 2006
[23:08 - 23:12] Speaking of the past though, I've been thinking about the paw prints
[23:12 - 23:14] How is that possible?
[23:14 - 23:17] Wow, I think we have the same dog
[23:17 - 23:20] Oh yeah, what's yours like?
[23:20 - 23:22] According to the vet, my is eight years old
[23:22 - 23:24] In my time
[23:24 - 23:26] Six in yours
[23:26 - 23:28] She's skinny, has sad eyes
[23:28 - 23:30] Snores
[23:30 - 23:32] And sleeps like a person
[23:32 - 23:34] I don't know why, but I call her Jack
[23:34 - 23:36] Hello, Jack
[23:40 - 23:42] It's my son, Dan
[23:42 - 23:44] It's not bad for him
[23:44 - 23:46] Let's think
[23:46 - 23:48] Hey
[23:48 - 23:50] What are you doing? You're supposed to be asleep
[23:50 - 23:52] What's my fucking...
[23:56 - 23:58] No, I don't like to
[23:58 - 24:00] Is she gonna marry him?
[24:00 - 24:02] What do you think?
[24:02 - 24:05] I don't know, he's kinda old
[24:05 - 24:07] Okay, it's not that old
[24:08 - 24:11] My mom's last boyfriend was bald
[24:11 - 24:13] He was nice
[24:13 - 24:15] But my mom didn't marry him, no?
[24:15 - 24:19] There's always something better coming along the corner
[24:19 - 24:21] That's what she says
[24:21 - 24:25] Maybe that's what that lady should do
[24:25 - 24:27] If something better comes along the corner
[24:27 - 24:29] Maybe
[24:29 - 24:33] If she's not careful, she could spend her whole life waiting
[24:35 - 24:37] I want you to bring everything back to me
[24:37 - 24:41] Yes, but it's not nice because the wine is a centipede
[24:41 - 24:43] Sorry, I haven't made it to the mailbox lately
[24:43 - 24:45] It's been a long week
[24:45 - 24:47] All night shifts
[24:47 - 24:49] Good to hear from you
[24:49 - 24:51] I thought you left me
[24:51 - 24:53] You should know that you're my only connection to the future
[24:53 - 24:57] How come we never talk about the things we like?
[24:57 - 24:59] Well, let's see
[24:59 - 25:01] Reading the classics to Jack
[25:01 - 25:03] Who's his favorite?
[25:03 - 25:05] Dustoy Evsky
[25:05 - 25:07] For me, this city
[25:07 - 25:09] On a day when the light is so clear that I can touch every detail
[25:09 - 25:13] Every brick and window in the building are long
[25:13 - 25:15] Come on, take a walk with me
[25:15 - 25:17] This Saturday, let me show you
[25:17 - 25:19] You're crazy
[25:19 - 25:21] Why are you going through all this trouble for me?
[25:21 - 25:23] No trouble, summer's here
[25:23 - 25:25] Walk down the street
[25:25 - 25:27] Don't think you can
[25:27 - 25:29] I'm going to be a little bit more careful
[25:29 - 25:31] I'm going to be a little bit more careful
[25:31 - 25:33] Walk down the street
[25:33 - 25:35] Don't think you can
[25:35 - 25:39] Everybody's alone
[25:39 - 25:41] I've got to say
[25:41 - 25:43] How are you needing to be alone?
[25:43 - 25:47] Okay, your turn, favorite things
[25:47 - 25:49] Where to start
[25:49 - 25:51] Okay
[25:51 - 25:53] When I smell the flowers before I see them
[25:53 - 25:55] When it starts to rain
[25:55 - 25:57] Just as the picnic is ending
[25:57 - 26:01] And I love the smell of Jack's paws
[26:01 - 26:05] You didn't forget to mention your husband, did you?
[26:05 - 26:09] Oh, well, of course I love my husband
[26:09 - 26:11] Who is also a doctor, plastic surgeon
[26:11 - 26:13] For small farm animals
[26:13 - 26:15] Good, I'm married too
[26:15 - 26:17] I've got eight children
[26:17 - 26:19] And none of them look like me
[26:19 - 26:21] I'm worried, Kate
[26:21 - 26:23] I would be two
[26:23 - 26:25] I'm single
[26:25 - 26:26] Me too
[26:26 - 26:28] Oh, wow
[26:28 - 26:30] Number 27
[26:30 - 26:32] She's a beauty
[26:32 - 26:36] My father used to tell me she was the grandlock for all the houses in the city
[26:36 - 26:40] He used to take me on walks like I'm taking you now
[26:40 - 26:42] Alex
[26:42 - 26:44] Kate
[26:44 - 26:46] I wish we could have done this walk together
[26:56 - 26:58] So what do you think?
[26:58 - 27:00] It sounds like a nice boy
[27:00 - 27:04] It sounds like a nice boy, anything else?
[27:04 - 27:06] He has wonderful penmanship
[27:06 - 27:10] Look at the date, it's all no matter the date
[27:10 - 27:12] Oh, you mean the time scene?
[27:12 - 27:14] Yes, it's just a detail
[27:14 - 27:16] Just a detail?
[27:26 - 27:38] About the other day, it was not a good moment I was in the Hallowire
[27:38 - 27:40] Of course
[27:40 - 27:42] That's my species here
[27:42 - 27:46] Oh yeah, music's fine, music helps
[27:46 - 27:50] It's like Nietzsche says
[27:50 - 27:54] Life would be senseless without music
[27:54 - 27:56] I guess I told you that
[27:56 - 27:58] Boy, you're self-at-drink
[27:58 - 28:00] And you appreciate a good one by now?
[28:00 - 28:02] I bet
[28:04 - 28:10] You don't have to forgive your father, they're being curious but where have you been all these years?
[28:10 - 28:14] I thought you're Kiroak Days with a hundred
[28:14 - 28:16] I'm sorry, what?
[28:16 - 28:18] What?
[28:18 - 28:22] Oh, you can come up if you like
[28:24 - 28:26] What are you working on?
[28:26 - 28:36] Oh, I'm just remembering things
[28:36 - 28:38] That's such an easy job, let me tell you
[28:38 - 28:42] Nor is it particularly innocent in my case
[28:42 - 28:46] Your father is writing his memoirs
[28:46 - 28:48] Are we that?
[28:48 - 28:50] What do you think, do you want to be?
[28:50 - 28:52] What do you?
[28:52 - 28:54] Of course
[28:54 - 28:56] You were all the part of your father's life
[28:56 - 29:00] Why are you talking to me in the third person?
[29:00 - 29:02] Wow, yeah
[29:02 - 29:04] Because I'm writing about myself as a person
[29:04 - 29:06] Why doesn't it suit you?
[29:08 - 29:10] I thought
[29:10 - 29:12] You might like these
[29:12 - 29:16] I wanted these, something you've been working on
[29:16 - 29:18] No, they're yours
[29:18 - 29:20] From a house I just bought
[29:20 - 29:22] From the lake
[29:22 - 29:24] Oh yes, I heard
[29:24 - 29:28] They said some sleazy little condo developer snapped it up
[29:28 - 29:30] Oh, come on
[29:30 - 29:32] Indulge your father
[29:32 - 29:36] Can't you take a little joke for God's sake?
[29:36 - 29:38] Come on
[29:38 - 29:40] Tell me
[29:40 - 29:42] Where have you been?
[29:42 - 29:44] I really want to know
[29:44 - 29:46] I was trying to forget you
[29:46 - 29:48] I'm forgetting you
[29:48 - 29:52] Did you succeed?
[29:52 - 29:54] No
[29:58 - 30:02] Let me know if you need any help for memory
[30:02 - 30:04] Oh yeah, I will
[30:04 - 30:06] In pre-60 you get one little riled up and down
[30:06 - 30:08] And you're ready to get it to the playoff
[30:08 - 30:10] The whole playoff
[30:10 - 30:12] All compression start begging
[30:12 - 30:14] Let's go to rhythm
[30:14 - 30:16] Slow
[30:16 - 30:18] We have a pulse with that
[30:18 - 30:20] Not a pulse straight
[30:20 - 30:22] Long days these days
[30:22 - 30:24] I just work 30 hours straight
[30:24 - 30:26] Every time I stop to take a breath
[30:26 - 30:30] I realize how isolated I've let myself become
[30:30 - 30:32] Believe me
[30:32 - 30:34] I'm not going to be able to do it
[30:34 - 30:36] I'm not going to be able to do it
[30:36 - 30:38] I want to let myself become
[30:38 - 30:40] Believe me
[30:40 - 30:42] Can't you get a bit…
[30:42 - 30:44] desperate
[30:44 - 30:46] That one?
[30:46 - 30:48] Okay, here you go
[30:48 - 30:50] Very nice
[30:50 - 30:52] Nice
[30:54 - 30:56] It's not that I'm complaining
[30:56 - 30:58] I love my work
[30:58 - 31:00] And our tour through Chicago
[31:00 - 31:02] Opened my eyes to its beauty
[31:02 - 31:04] But my heart still misses the likehouse
[31:04 - 31:06] and it's trees.
[31:08 - 31:10] I miss those trees so much.
[32:04 - 32:06] I miss those trees.
[32:28 - 32:30] Don't worry Kate.
[32:30 - 32:32] We'll be together in time.
[32:32 - 32:34] We'll be together for far apart.
[32:34 - 32:36] Find a way to be close to you and take care of you.
[32:42 - 32:44] Get the greener!
[32:46 - 32:48] Take this.
[32:48 - 32:50] You should eat more.
[32:50 - 32:52] You do skinnier. Remember.
[32:52 - 32:54] How you used to eat when you were little.
[32:54 - 32:56] Yes, I remember.
[32:56 - 33:00] Did you or not write to each other?
[33:00 - 33:02] No, the carcable.
[33:02 - 33:04] Yes, to dad.
[33:08 - 33:12] What mom?
[33:12 - 33:14] Before your father.
[33:14 - 33:16] Yes?
[33:16 - 33:20] There was this boy.
[33:24 - 33:26] Did you love him?
[33:26 - 33:28] Yes.
[33:30 - 33:32] Why don't you marry him?
[33:36 - 33:40] So you could ask me this question some day.
[33:50 - 33:52] Look smaller.
[33:54 - 33:56] I've winded you completed it.
[33:56 - 34:00] You weren't born yet and I was eight.
[34:06 - 34:08] Blue ZA me to Frank Lloyd Wright.
[34:08 - 34:12] You know dad played cards with both of them.
[34:12 - 34:14] Let's share it a joint.
[34:14 - 34:16] Yeah, well.
[34:16 - 34:18] I can't swim.
[34:18 - 34:22] It should be a stairway down to the water.
[34:22 - 34:24] A porch, a deck.
[34:24 - 34:26] Here you're in a box.
[34:26 - 34:30] A glass box will be viewed to everything that's around you.
[34:30 - 34:32] But you can't touch it.
[34:32 - 34:36] No interconnection between you and what you're looking at.
[34:36 - 34:40] I don't know. You know, he's got this big maple grown right in the middle of the house.
[34:40 - 34:42] Containment.
[34:46 - 34:50] Containment and control.
[34:50 - 34:54] This house is about ownership, not connection.
[34:54 - 34:58] I mean, it's beautiful.
[34:58 - 35:00] It's a duck to be.
[35:00 - 35:04] But it's incomplete.
[35:04 - 35:08] It was all about him.
[35:08 - 35:12] Dad knew how to build a house, not a home.
[35:12 - 35:16] But you know, I think he wants us to do what he could.
[35:16 - 35:18] But admitting that.
[35:18 - 35:24] We mean admitting that he came up short in some way.
[35:24 - 35:26] That he could do more.
[35:26 - 35:30] And that torches him.
[35:30 - 35:34] Do you remember being here with mom?
[35:38 - 35:42] I remember she tried to make it work here.
[35:42 - 35:44] With us.
[35:44 - 35:46] With him.
[35:48 - 35:50] Hey, what about visionary Vanguard?
[35:50 - 35:52] What about it?
[35:52 - 35:54] Come on.
[35:54 - 35:58] You can't convince me you're going to be happy building these salt boxes for tourists.
[35:58 - 36:00] But what is going to admire you for that?
[36:00 - 36:02] Admire me for that.
[36:02 - 36:04] Yeah, visionary Vanguard.
[36:04 - 36:06] That's your idea.
[36:06 - 36:08] I can't. But you can keep the name.
[36:08 - 36:10] No, come on. It's got to be you and me.
[36:10 - 36:12] Henry, I'm sorry, I can't.
[36:12 - 36:14] I just, uh...
[36:14 - 36:16] What?
[36:16 - 36:18] I've got other plans.
[36:18 - 36:22] Do you have a girlfriend?
[36:22 - 36:26] No, no.
[36:26 - 36:28] What is that? You hesitated.
[36:28 - 36:30] No, I didn't hesitated.
[36:30 - 36:34] Come on, man. I don't have any time for that.
[36:34 - 36:38] What does time have to do with it?
[36:38 - 36:42] Oh, you're going to think I'm crazy.
[36:42 - 36:50] My dearest, Mr. Wiler, are you willing to play a game with me?
[36:50 - 36:56] Two years ago today, I was taking the 145 trained amadison from the Riverside station,
[36:56 - 36:58] and I forgot something there.
[36:58 - 37:00] It was a gift from my father.
[37:00 - 37:06] If you find it, can you please put it in the mailbox?
[37:06 - 37:08] It would mean a lot.
[37:08 - 37:10] Yours. Kate.
[37:10 - 37:12] Kate.
[37:12 - 37:14] I'm sorry.
[37:14 - 37:16] I'm sorry.
[37:16 - 37:18] I'm sorry.
[37:18 - 37:20] I'm sorry.
[37:20 - 37:22] I'm sorry.
[37:22 - 37:24] I'm sorry.
[37:24 - 37:26] I'm sorry.
[37:26 - 37:28] I'm sorry.
[37:28 - 37:30] Final call.
[37:30 - 37:32] The number 546 is the man of choice.
[37:32 - 37:34] All the world.
[37:34 - 37:36] All the world.
[37:36 - 37:38] All the world.
[37:38 - 37:40] All the world.
[37:40 - 37:42] I'll call you.
[38:10 - 38:12] All the world.
[38:12 - 38:14] All the world.
[38:14 - 38:16] All the world.
[38:16 - 38:18] All the world.
[38:18 - 38:20] All the world.
[38:20 - 38:22] All the world.
[38:22 - 38:24] All the world.
[38:24 - 38:26] All the world.
[38:26 - 38:28] All the world.
[38:28 - 38:30] Kate, I found her.
[38:30 - 38:32] I have it with me.
[38:32 - 38:34] One day I'll get it to you.
[38:34 - 38:36] Trust me.
[38:36 - 38:38] I know how important it is to you.
[38:38 - 38:42] You might not remember, but we saw each other.
[38:42 - 38:44] At least I saw you.
[38:44 - 38:50] You never told me how beautiful you were.
[38:50 - 38:52] Well, maybe you saw somebody else.
[38:52 - 38:54] That was a bad hair year for me.
[38:54 - 38:56] Long brown hair.
[38:56 - 38:58] Gentle, unguarded eyes.
[38:58 - 39:00] Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[39:00 - 39:02] You saw me.
[39:02 - 39:06] But I still don't know what you look like.
[39:06 - 39:10] Well, why don't we just get together in the future
[39:10 - 39:14] and you can let me know what you think?
[39:14 - 39:16] It's a dead.
[39:16 - 39:20] Okay.
[39:20 - 39:30] Why don't you call me July 10th, 2006 at 9.05pm?
[39:30 - 39:32] I'm here.
[39:46 - 39:47] Hello?
[39:47 - 39:48] Kate?
[39:48 - 39:49] Yes?
[39:49 - 39:51] It's Morgan.
[39:54 - 39:56] Morgan.
[39:56 - 39:58] I'm here in Chicago.
[39:58 - 40:02] I came down for a meeting, but it was cancelled, so I thought you'd give your call.
[40:02 - 40:04] Have you eaten?
[40:04 - 40:06] No.
[40:06 - 40:08] I'm totally starving.
[40:08 - 40:10] We could grab a quick bite.
[40:10 - 40:12] Okay.
[40:12 - 40:14] All right.
[40:16 - 40:18] Looks pretty good.
[40:18 - 40:20] Oh.
[40:20 - 40:22] Perfect.
[40:22 - 40:24] No, Morgan.
[40:24 - 40:26] Okay.
[40:26 - 40:28] Oh, yeah.
[40:28 - 40:30] I'm sorry. Could you hold him for a moment?
[40:30 - 40:32] We'd love a table for two.
[40:32 - 40:34] The name?
[40:34 - 40:36] Oh, um, we don't have a reservation.
[40:36 - 40:40] I'm sorry, sir. I booked the October.
[40:40 - 40:42] October?
[40:44 - 40:48] Well, I'll get back to you.
[40:50 - 40:52] That went well.
[40:52 - 40:54] It's smoking for you.
[41:00 - 41:02] Oh, come on. Stop it.
[41:02 - 41:04] The best restaurant in town nobody gets a table here.
[41:04 - 41:06] No, it's not that.
[41:06 - 41:08] Oh, what is it?
[41:12 - 41:14] I didn't do this right.
[41:14 - 41:16] There wasn't a meeting.
[41:16 - 41:18] You saw me if there was no big deal.
[41:18 - 41:22] You know, coffee and coffee can turn into dinner.
[41:22 - 41:24] Dinner can turn into dinner.
[41:24 - 41:26] I'll admit.
[41:26 - 41:28] I do sometimes get a few steps ahead of myself.
[41:28 - 41:32] Morgan, few steps. You're always leaving 10 steps ahead.
[41:34 - 41:36] We were dating what a week.
[41:36 - 41:40] And you had our entire future map out there?
[41:40 - 41:42] Still, my residency you were thinking, you know, real estate.
[41:42 - 41:44] I would go to your house for the weekend.
[41:44 - 41:47] You'd have the entire town in your house to meet me.
[41:47 - 41:51] I do seem to remember that you made pretty fast friends with Morgan.
[41:51 - 41:53] What?
[41:53 - 41:55] You know what I've talked about.
[41:55 - 41:57] A guy?
[41:57 - 41:59] The guy I caught you making out with?
[41:59 - 42:01] What was it making out with him?
[42:01 - 42:03] What are we doing in high school right now?
[42:03 - 42:05] We followed them.
[42:05 - 42:07] A kiss?
[42:07 - 42:11] It was just one kiss with some random guy that just years ago.
[42:11 - 42:13] You know what?
[42:13 - 42:17] Unit 381 on Riviera States is complete.
[42:17 - 42:19] Cheers!
[42:19 - 42:21] Good job!
[42:25 - 42:27] One down?
[42:27 - 42:29] 44 to go.
[42:29 - 42:33] We're not terrifying when you're behind schedule just alarmingly.
[42:33 - 42:35] It's gonna be okay, the guys are getting another job.
[42:35 - 42:37] We could use another backhoe.
[42:37 - 42:41] And the wire on 14 needs to be resealed.
[42:41 - 42:42] Shut up.
[42:42 - 42:43] What?
[42:43 - 42:45] We're kinda disappointed in you.
[42:45 - 42:46] Why?
[42:46 - 42:49] Because you're supposed to be on top of things around here.
[42:49 - 42:51] I thought I was.
[42:51 - 42:53] You'd never notice these.
[42:53 - 42:56] Don't you remember you told me to get them?
[42:56 - 42:57] Right, right.
[42:57 - 43:00] Wow, not exactly what I had in mind, but...
[43:00 - 43:02] You like them?
[43:02 - 43:04] I like them.
[43:04 - 43:06] I think we should go out tonight.
[43:06 - 43:08] I'm not.
[43:08 - 43:10] Check.
[43:10 - 43:12] Check.
[43:20 - 43:22] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[43:22 - 43:24] Check!
[43:31 - 43:33] Check!
[43:41 - 43:43] Yeah!
[43:53 - 43:55] You're as I take it?
[43:55 - 43:58] Yeah, yeah, sorry, thanks.
[43:58 - 44:00] Come here, Jack.
[44:00 - 44:01] What were you thinking?
[44:01 - 44:02] How, girl?
[44:02 - 44:03] What were you thinking?
[44:03 - 44:05] I just never run off like that before.
[44:05 - 44:06] Keep an eye on them.
[44:06 - 44:07] What's his name?
[44:07 - 44:08] Her.
[44:08 - 44:09] Jack.
[44:09 - 44:11] Good name for a girl.
[44:11 - 44:13] She's got one like you from my girlfriend.
[44:13 - 44:14] She loves dogs.
[44:14 - 44:16] Everything I'd be for.
[44:16 - 44:17] Thanks, Seth.
[44:17 - 44:18] Organ price.
[44:18 - 44:20] Alex, what?
[44:20 - 44:22] Hey, man, you need a hand with this?
[44:22 - 44:23] Yeah.
[44:23 - 44:24] What you want?
[44:24 - 44:25] There's a few months.
[44:25 - 44:26] I'm gonna play some of it.
[44:26 - 44:28] Well, like it, really.
[44:28 - 44:30] I can think of...
[44:30 - 44:31] Oh, man.
[44:31 - 44:33] Thank God he found him.
[44:33 - 44:34] Yeah.
[44:34 - 44:35] Mona.
[44:35 - 44:36] Morgan.
[44:36 - 44:37] Oh, hello.
[44:38 - 44:39] Did you meet you?
[44:39 - 44:40] I just made you two.
[44:40 - 44:42] Nice food, Seth.
[44:42 - 44:44] Listen, just so you don't think I'm gonna drink all this
[44:44 - 44:45] by myself.
[44:45 - 44:47] I'm having a bunch of friends over tonight for a party.
[44:47 - 44:49] You two are welcome to come.
[44:49 - 44:50] Mm-hmm.
[44:50 - 44:53] Oh, uh, hey, Alex.
[44:53 - 44:54] Take my card.
[44:54 - 44:57] I might be looking to run a place that'll link myself.
[44:57 - 44:58] Okay.
[44:58 - 44:59] It's Kate, my girlfriend.
[44:59 - 45:01] She's never really liked this place.
[45:01 - 45:03] I promised her we'd look for something new.
[45:03 - 45:05] Once she finishes a residency in Madison.
[45:05 - 45:08] So if you hear of anything...
[45:08 - 45:10] Sure, she's a doctor.
[45:10 - 45:12] Yeah.
[45:12 - 45:13] Alex.
[45:20 - 45:21] Great to meet you, Morgan.
[45:21 - 45:23] Great to meet you, all right.
[45:26 - 45:29] Hey, Morgan, what time's that party at?
[45:29 - 45:30] Made a clock?
[45:30 - 45:32] Kate's birthday.
[45:32 - 45:34] Come on, Jack.
[45:34 - 45:36] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[45:36 - 45:38] One of us is changing.
[45:38 - 45:41] Or maybe we just stop trying.
[45:44 - 45:47] And it's too late, baby.
[45:47 - 45:49] Now it's too late.
[45:49 - 45:53] So we really did try to make it.
[45:54 - 45:57] Something inside has kind of lacking.
[45:57 - 45:59] Hide and adjust.
[45:59 - 46:00] Okay.
[46:00 - 46:02] Come on, get it.
[46:02 - 46:03] Come on.
[46:03 - 46:04] Okay.
[46:04 - 46:05] Okay.
[46:05 - 46:06] Okay.
[46:06 - 46:07] Okay.
[46:07 - 46:08] Okay.
[46:08 - 46:09] Okay.
[46:09 - 46:10] Okay.
[46:10 - 46:11] Okay.
[46:11 - 46:12] Okay.
[46:12 - 46:13] Okay.
[46:13 - 46:14] Okay.
[46:14 - 46:15] Okay.
[46:15 - 46:16] Okay.
[46:16 - 46:17] Okay.
[46:17 - 46:18] Okay.
[46:18 - 46:19] Okay.
[46:19 - 46:20] Okay.
[46:20 - 46:21] Okay.
[46:21 - 46:22] Okay.
[46:22 - 46:24] Okay.
[46:44 - 46:47] According to most accepted social norms,
[46:47 - 46:51] the person should not drink a little off the tantrum.
[46:51 - 46:53] Unless they have a good excuse.
[46:53 - 46:56] What's yours?
[46:56 - 46:58] Gosh, don't have one.
[46:58 - 47:01] I do.
[47:01 - 47:04] My youngest left for college this morning.
[47:04 - 47:08] Marie, one day she's splashing around
[47:08 - 47:10] and waiting for him diapers.
[47:10 - 47:12] Then she's packing up a board ball
[47:12 - 47:15] and driving to California.
[47:15 - 47:19] I just hope she knows what she's getting into.
[47:19 - 47:21] Don't tell me.
[47:21 - 47:22] Pre-med?
[47:22 - 47:23] Ingo.
[47:26 - 47:28] Hey, how are you?
[47:28 - 47:29] You see it?
[47:29 - 47:31] You're gonna meet some friends of mine.
[47:31 - 47:33] Alex, Marta?
[47:33 - 47:34] The Wuch?
[47:34 - 47:35] Susan?
[47:35 - 47:36] Johnny?
[47:36 - 47:37] Let's get you something to drink.
[47:37 - 47:38] Come on, back here.
[47:38 - 47:39] Far back here.
[47:39 - 47:40] Come on.
[47:40 - 47:42] Hey, this is Marjorie.
[47:42 - 47:44] Why didn't you mention it was today?
[47:44 - 47:46] We would have had a cake for you or something.
[47:46 - 47:48] It's just time passing.
[47:48 - 47:50] They're making a big deal out of it.
[47:50 - 47:52] You give a lot to yourself.
[47:52 - 47:55] Nothing wrong with it.
[47:55 - 47:57] But if sometimes when they're...
[47:57 - 48:00] What else you have in your life besides work?
[48:00 - 48:02] Family, boyfriend.
[48:02 - 48:04] Oh, I did.
[48:04 - 48:05] Once?
[48:05 - 48:07] His name was Morgan.
[48:07 - 48:09] Morgan?
[48:09 - 48:10] Morgan?
[48:10 - 48:11] Morgan?
[48:11 - 48:13] That's a sexy name.
[48:18 - 48:20] I'm not a sexy name.
[48:20 - 48:22] I'm a sexy name.
[48:22 - 48:24] I'm a sexy name.
[48:24 - 48:26] I'm a sexy name.
[48:26 - 48:28] I'm a sexy name.
[48:28 - 48:31] I'm a sexy name.
[48:31 - 48:33] I'm a sexy name.
[48:33 - 48:35] Okay, talk to you.
[48:35 - 48:37] I can't.
[48:37 - 48:40] Okay.
[48:40 - 48:43] This is Alex and Mona.
[48:43 - 48:46] This guy's gonna help us find our late house.
[48:46 - 48:48] Okay.
[48:48 - 48:51] You have an old chain.
[48:51 - 48:54] Anyway, well, I ended it.
[48:54 - 48:59] And I'm happy now and it was the right thing to do.
[48:59 - 49:03] So, oh, is it your right to...
[49:03 - 49:06] I couldn't help every time you hit a break at the hospital
[49:06 - 49:08] and you're writing something.
[49:08 - 49:10] There is someone.
[49:10 - 49:13] It's kind of a long-distance relationship.
[49:13 - 49:15] How did you meet?
[49:15 - 49:16] What?
[49:16 - 49:18] You know, a story of my life.
[49:18 - 49:20] You were kidding.
[49:20 - 49:22] Everything at a distance.
[49:22 - 49:25] Everyone.
[49:25 - 49:27] The man who was standing right in front of me,
[49:27 - 49:29] the one that wanted to marry me,
[49:29 - 49:32] him I pushed away, and I run from him.
[49:32 - 49:35] In the meantime, the...
[49:35 - 49:38] one man I can never meet.
[49:38 - 49:44] Him, I would like to give my whole heart to.
[49:44 - 49:48] He must write one hell of a letter.
[49:48 - 49:51] It's nice.
[49:51 - 49:53] It's safe.
[49:53 - 49:55] Christ, he's in prison, isn't he?
[49:55 - 49:56] No.
[49:56 - 49:58] You're one of those women, aren't you?
[49:58 - 50:03] Christ is the guy who's on a lake in the architect.
[50:03 - 50:07] Oh.
[50:14 - 50:21] Oh.
[50:21 - 50:26] Oh.
[50:26 - 50:33] Oh, my God.
[50:33 - 50:37] Happy birthday.
[50:37 - 50:40] Thank you.
[50:40 - 50:42] I hope it's a great year for you.
[50:42 - 50:46] I'm Alex.
[50:46 - 50:49] How's Guy?
[50:49 - 50:50] Oh, yeah.
[50:50 - 50:56] How you doing?
[50:56 - 51:05] May I?
[51:05 - 51:15] So you're going to...
[51:15 - 51:17] you're going to find us a place on the lake, huh?
[51:17 - 51:18] I hope so.
[51:18 - 51:19] Yeah.
[51:19 - 51:20] I can.
[51:20 - 51:22] You're a real estate agent?
[51:22 - 51:23] No.
[51:23 - 51:26] I just have a lake house.
[51:26 - 51:27] Oh.
[51:27 - 51:28] Is it nice?
[51:28 - 51:30] Yeah, you're loving.
[51:30 - 51:32] You're going to rent it after I move on.
[51:32 - 51:34] Really?
[51:34 - 51:37] Okay.
[51:37 - 51:40] Have you...
[51:40 - 51:43] read persuasion?
[51:43 - 51:46] What?
[51:46 - 51:48] By Jane Austen.
[51:48 - 51:51] I know, it's by.
[51:51 - 51:54] Yeah, it's um...
[51:54 - 51:57] It's my favorite book.
[51:57 - 51:59] Why did you bring something like that up?
[51:59 - 52:01] What made you bring that up?
[52:01 - 52:06] It's a friend of mine gave it to me recently and I was wondering...
[52:06 - 52:09] what's about.
[52:09 - 52:12] It's wonderful.
[52:12 - 52:13] Yeah.
[52:13 - 52:16] It's about...
[52:16 - 52:21] about waiting.
[52:21 - 52:24] It's two people they meet.
[52:24 - 52:26] They almost fall in love.
[52:26 - 52:29] But the timing isn't right.
[52:29 - 52:32] They have to part.
[52:32 - 52:40] And then years later they meet again and get another chance.
[52:40 - 52:44] You know, they don't know if too much time has passed.
[52:44 - 52:47] It waited too long.
[52:47 - 52:55] You know, too late to make it work.
[52:55 - 52:57] Why do you like that?
[52:57 - 52:59] I don't.
[52:59 - 53:01] No, don't get me wrong.
[53:01 - 53:03] It's beautiful when they cut that.
[53:03 - 53:06] It's terrible.
[53:06 - 53:09] It's terrible.
[53:09 - 53:11] That's...
[53:11 - 53:14] Yeah, it's terrible.
[53:14 - 53:17] It's a personal question.
[53:17 - 53:21] Have you ever been to anything like that?
[53:21 - 53:24] Me, no.
[53:28 - 53:32] When I was...
[53:32 - 53:36] when I was 16.
[53:36 - 53:41] I was completely in love with this guy.
[53:41 - 53:44] Like a guitar.
[53:44 - 53:51] I ran away from home and went to San Francisco so I could go live with him.
[53:51 - 53:55] Yeah, he convinced me I had a beautiful voice.
[53:55 - 54:00] I dreamed of becoming a singer.
[54:00 - 54:02] I love San Francisco.
[54:02 - 54:06] He was my first love.
[54:06 - 54:10] Probably the only one.
[54:10 - 54:12] You must have been a great guy.
[54:12 - 54:14] I don't know.
[54:14 - 54:15] You may have been.
[54:15 - 54:19] I didn't last long enough for me to find out.
[54:19 - 54:24] Truth is, I can't remember what he looked like.
[54:24 - 54:26] Really?
[54:26 - 54:28] Yeah.
[54:28 - 54:30] It was too bad.
[54:30 - 54:33] My dad showed up.
[54:33 - 54:34] Actually.
[54:34 - 54:36] Yeah, he treated me.
[54:36 - 54:38] He was in trouble.
[54:38 - 54:41] He yanked me back to Chicago.
[54:41 - 54:44] He was sick.
[54:44 - 54:48] He had these dreams of me becoming a doctor.
[54:48 - 54:51] You know?
[54:51 - 54:58] I want to mention, maybe he came my dream soon.
[54:58 - 55:01] He was right.
[55:01 - 55:05] You know, I feel good helping people.
[55:10 - 55:14] Any time?
[55:14 - 55:21] Okay.
[55:21 - 55:26] What?
[55:32 - 55:37] I, uh...
[55:37 - 55:40] You.
[55:45 - 55:47] I just...
[55:47 - 55:53] What?
[55:53 - 55:56] Do you know the song?
[55:56 - 55:58] Mm-hmm.
[55:58 - 56:04] Yeah.
[56:04 - 56:06] Do you sing?
[56:06 - 56:07] No.
[56:07 - 56:09] Nobody wants to hear me sing.
[56:09 - 56:11] You don't want to hear me sing.
[56:11 - 56:16] I, I didn't mean, you know.
[56:16 - 56:23] I, yeah.
[56:23 - 56:28] But I can dance.
[56:28 - 56:32] Now I see.
[56:32 - 56:38] This is the way it should be.
[56:38 - 56:45] For lovers, they shouldn't go in alone.
[56:45 - 56:52] It's not so good when you're on your own.
[56:52 - 56:59] So come to me.
[56:59 - 57:04] Now we can be what we want to be.
[57:04 - 57:10] I love you.
[57:10 - 57:15] Now I see.
[57:15 - 57:21] This is the way it should be.
[57:21 - 57:27] This is the way it should be.
[57:27 - 57:33] This is the way it should be.
[57:33 - 57:39] They shouldn't go in alone.
[57:39 - 57:48] It's not so good when you're on your own.
[57:48 - 57:58] I'm very sure this never happened to be before.
[57:58 - 58:04] I met you, but now I'm sure.
[58:04 - 58:10] This never happened before.
[58:10 - 58:16] This never happened before.
[58:16 - 58:19] This never happened before.
[58:19 - 58:24] This never happened before.
[58:28 - 58:34] This never happened before.
[58:34 - 58:39] This never happened before.
[58:39 - 58:46] Okay.
[58:46 - 58:50] Hey.
[58:50 - 58:57] Alex was just telling me about the, um, the lake house.
[58:57 - 59:00] Yeah, it sounds really great.
[59:00 - 59:03] Great.
[59:03 - 59:08] Alex, it's late.
[59:08 - 59:11] Yeah.
[59:11 - 59:26] Good night.
[59:26 - 59:30] It was you.
[59:30 - 59:32] Why didn't you say anything?
[59:32 - 59:36] I would have thought I was crazy, drunk, or both.
[59:36 - 59:39] Yeah, but I liked you.
[59:39 - 59:41] You should have said something.
[59:41 - 59:44] How? You were with your boyfriend.
[59:44 - 59:45] You know what?
[59:45 - 59:46] Excuse me, excuse me.
[59:46 - 59:47] You are a coward.
[59:47 - 59:49] I'm not a coward.
[59:49 - 59:50] Oh, really?
[59:50 - 59:54] Well, what about your girlfriend?
[59:54 - 59:55] What?
[59:55 - 59:57] I told you already she's not my girlfriend.
[59:57 - 59:59] She's not my boyfriend.
[59:59 - 01:00:00] Oh, really?
[01:00:00 - 01:00:02] Well, what does he have?
[01:00:02 - 01:00:03] Your brother?
[01:00:03 - 01:00:05] Ah, you have a comedian.
[01:00:05 - 01:00:06] What do you have?
[01:00:06 - 01:00:10] A clown for breakfast this morning?
[01:00:10 - 01:00:13] Wonderful, our first fight.
[01:00:13 - 01:00:21] You could write a song about it and go sing it in San Francisco.
[01:00:21 - 01:00:23] What?
[01:00:23 - 01:00:25] Hello?
[01:00:25 - 01:00:28] Hey, Henry.
[01:00:28 - 01:00:30] What?
[01:00:35 - 01:00:36] Hi.
[01:00:36 - 01:00:37] Good afternoon.
[01:00:37 - 01:00:39] Looking for my father, I don't know which room he's in.
[01:00:39 - 01:00:40] Simon Wiler?
[01:00:40 - 01:00:42] Mr. Wiler, do you want to take it?
[01:00:42 - 01:00:43] Yes.
[01:00:43 - 01:00:44] I'm Anna Krizinski.
[01:00:44 - 01:00:47] I'm the attending for your father.
[01:00:47 - 01:00:48] What happened?
[01:00:48 - 01:00:49] How is it?
[01:00:49 - 01:00:50] He's okay.
[01:00:50 - 01:00:51] He's had a heart attack.
[01:00:51 - 01:00:54] Fortunately, relatively minor.
[01:00:54 - 01:00:57] His vitals are fine and his stable.
[01:00:57 - 01:00:59] But it will require an intervention.
[01:00:59 - 01:01:02] Is it great to schedule it for tomorrow?
[01:01:17 - 01:01:20] Good to see you're taking it easy.
[01:01:21 - 01:01:23] Well, you didn't need to come.
[01:01:23 - 01:01:25] I'm perfectly well.
[01:01:25 - 01:01:28] Perfect, all right.
[01:01:28 - 01:01:30] Yeah, had a heart attack, dad.
[01:01:30 - 01:01:33] I had an episode for Christ's sake.
[01:01:33 - 01:01:36] Nothing more.
[01:01:36 - 01:01:37] I appreciate it.
[01:01:37 - 01:01:39] You kept everything in its perspective.
[01:01:42 - 01:01:45] Let me just want to let you know I'm here if you need anything.
[01:01:47 - 01:01:49] Coffee.
[01:01:50 - 01:01:52] What?
[01:01:52 - 01:01:53] You heard me.
[01:01:56 - 01:01:57] Coffee.
[01:02:00 - 01:02:02] There's something I never told you came.
[01:02:02 - 01:02:05] You see, it was my father who built the lake house.
[01:02:05 - 01:02:08] I mean, with his own hands.
[01:02:08 - 01:02:14] It was a long time ago before he was famous when he still had a family and worshiped my mother.
[01:02:14 - 01:02:18] Her name was Mary, and the house was a gift for her.
[01:02:19 - 01:02:21] She was smart and funny.
[01:02:21 - 01:02:27] She could have done anything, but chose to take care of my brother and I, and help him build his career.
[01:02:27 - 01:02:31] You see, the more successfully became the more impossible he was to live with.
[01:02:31 - 01:02:35] Finally, she just couldn't take living with him anymore.
[01:02:35 - 01:02:38] She left him.
[01:02:38 - 01:02:41] Within a year, she got sick.
[01:02:41 - 01:02:44] Unfortunately, she never learned how to stop loving him.
[01:02:45 - 01:02:48] He wasn't at the funeral.
[01:02:49 - 01:02:52] When I asked him why.
[01:02:57 - 01:03:00] Come on, Alex, what did he say?
[01:03:04 - 01:03:08] He said she was dead to me the moment she stepped out of the house.
[01:03:09 - 01:03:14] And then he gave me one of his architecturally year grins.
[01:03:30 - 01:03:32] I hope you appreciate this.
[01:03:32 - 01:03:35] I'd have sneak past three nurses in your attending.
[01:03:35 - 01:03:37] Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:03:38 - 01:03:39] It's not decapital.
[01:03:39 - 01:03:41] It should be, but it isn't.
[01:03:45 - 01:03:46] Well, that's not bad.
[01:03:46 - 01:03:47] Thank you.
[01:03:47 - 01:03:49] Son.
[01:03:49 - 01:03:51] You're welcome.
[01:03:51 - 01:03:52] Where's your brother?
[01:03:52 - 01:03:55] I sent him away. He wasn't feeling well.
[01:03:55 - 01:03:58] You know how he is, he worries.
[01:03:58 - 01:04:03] Yeah, you can send from your mother. I'm afraid she always worried too much.
[01:04:03 - 01:04:05] When are you looking at him?
[01:04:05 - 01:04:07] Oh, yeah, he takes a gander.
[01:04:07 - 01:04:10] It's a proposal for a museum.
[01:04:10 - 01:04:14] Who is it? Don't someone new?
[01:04:14 - 01:04:16] I like the walkways.
[01:04:16 - 01:04:18] Where the light falls.
[01:04:18 - 01:04:20] Where are the materials?
[01:04:20 - 01:04:22] Ground it, one in a minute.
[01:04:22 - 01:04:29] White panels are straight out of the wire, but the interior color coming through the front window, since different.
[01:04:29 - 01:04:33] It's not new, but it's clean and cluttered.
[01:04:34 - 01:04:36] I like it.
[01:04:36 - 01:04:41] When was the last time you were in Barcelona?
[01:04:41 - 01:04:44] Years ago with you, mom and Henry.
[01:04:44 - 01:04:47] Do you remember visiting Kazajura Karita?
[01:04:47 - 01:04:49] The old-south.
[01:04:49 - 01:04:51] That's right.
[01:04:51 - 01:04:52] You mentioned Meyer.
[01:04:52 - 01:04:57] His Barcelona Museum stands in the same area as Kazajura Karita.
[01:04:57 - 01:04:59] It drinks the same light.
[01:05:00 - 01:05:08] Meyer designed a series of louvered skylights to capture that light and cast it inward to illuminate the art within.
[01:05:08 - 01:05:16] But indirectly, and that was important, because although light enhances art, it can also degrade it.
[01:05:16 - 01:05:19] But you know that already.
[01:05:19 - 01:05:22] Now this.
[01:05:22 - 01:05:26] When do you suppose this is meant to be built?
[01:05:26 - 01:05:27] I have no idea.
[01:05:27 - 01:05:29] Oh, but you said you might.
[01:05:29 - 01:05:30] Conceptually.
[01:05:30 - 01:05:32] Come on.
[01:05:32 - 01:05:37] You know as well as I do that the light in Barcelona is quite different from the light in Tokyo.
[01:05:37 - 01:05:41] And the light in Tokyo is different from that in Prague.
[01:05:41 - 01:05:43] A truly great structure.
[01:05:43 - 01:05:50] One that is meant to stand the tests of time, never disregards this environment.
[01:05:50 - 01:05:52] A serious architect takes that into account.
[01:05:52 - 01:05:56] He knows that if he wants presents, he must consult with nature.
[01:05:57 - 01:06:01] He must be captivated by the light.
[01:06:01 - 01:06:03] Always the light.
[01:06:03 - 01:06:04] Always.
[01:06:57 - 01:07:02] Hey, I have an emergency. Take my shift. Please.
[01:07:07 - 01:07:09] Hello?
[01:07:09 - 01:07:11] Mr. Wiley.
[01:07:11 - 01:07:12] Yes?
[01:07:12 - 01:07:16] This is Dr. Clizinski at Chicago City Hospital.
[01:07:16 - 01:07:20] I am afraid I have some difficult news for you.
[01:07:22 - 01:07:25] I'm so sorry, Alex.
[01:07:26 - 01:07:30] I wish somehow I could be there with you.
[01:07:30 - 01:07:39] That we could sit together and look out over the water in the light in this house your father built.
[01:07:39 - 01:07:48] I could be a shoulder for you like you've been for me and tell you that everything is going to be okay.
[01:07:48 - 01:07:53] If I could do one thing for you today, from here,
[01:07:53 - 01:07:57] one small simple thing from the future.
[01:07:57 - 01:08:00] I hope this is it.
[01:08:00 - 01:08:07] It won't be published for a couple of years, but I don't think you should have to wait that long.
[01:08:07 - 01:08:12] I hope it helps you know how much you were loved.
[01:08:53 - 01:08:56] Oh.
[01:09:23 - 01:09:26] I'm sorry.
[01:09:54 - 01:09:58] Pick a place. I'll be there. Promise.
[01:09:58 - 01:10:00] Tomorrow, what do you say?
[01:10:00 - 01:10:03] But Alex, it will be tomorrow for you. You're going to have to wait.
[01:10:03 - 01:10:05] I know. I don't care. I'll wait.
[01:10:05 - 01:10:07] Are you sure? I don't know.
[01:10:07 - 01:10:10] I do. I've never been so sure of anything in my life.
[01:10:10 - 01:10:13] Okay. I'll see you in two years.
[01:10:13 - 01:10:15] I'll see you tomorrow, man.
[01:10:15 - 01:10:17] Kate.
[01:10:17 - 01:10:20] Where would you like to go?
[01:10:21 - 01:10:24] Oh, Mari.
[01:10:24 - 01:10:27] I'm where you would be to die with us.
[01:10:27 - 01:10:29] Two years from tomorrow.
[01:10:29 - 01:10:31] Two years from tomorrow.
[01:10:31 - 01:10:33] Two years.
[01:10:33 - 01:10:35] From tomorrow.
[01:10:35 - 01:10:37] Hi. Hello. Name?
[01:10:37 - 01:10:39] Forrester. Can I have your name?
[01:10:39 - 01:10:40] Wailer.
[01:10:40 - 01:10:43] Or, uh, Wailer. I'm really not sure.
[01:10:43 - 01:10:45] I think we should be able to accommodate you, sir.
[01:10:45 - 01:10:46] Great.
[01:10:46 - 01:10:48] Wailer.
[01:10:48 - 01:10:50] Wailer.
[01:10:50 - 01:10:53] You're way to early right with you.
[01:10:54 - 01:10:56] Wailer.
[01:10:56 - 01:10:59] Wailer.
[01:10:59 - 01:11:02] Wailer.
[01:11:02 - 01:11:05] Wailer.
[01:11:05 - 01:11:08] Wailer.
[01:11:08 - 01:11:12] Wailer.
[01:11:12 - 01:11:16] Wailer.
[01:11:16 - 01:11:21] Good evening, miss.
[01:11:22 - 01:11:24] Complementing.
[01:11:35 - 01:11:38] Good luck.
[01:11:51 - 01:11:57] They won't thrill me like yours used to be.
[01:11:57 - 01:12:00] Good luck.
[01:12:00 - 01:12:03] Another glass for the lady?
[01:12:03 - 01:12:06] What?
[01:12:06 - 01:12:09] You're here.
[01:12:09 - 01:12:15] And more than well, I wish you love.
[01:12:21 - 01:12:28] I wish you shelter from the storm.
[01:12:28 - 01:12:33] A cozy fire to keep you warm.
[01:12:33 - 01:12:43] But most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you...
[01:12:43 - 01:12:53] When snowflakes fall, I wish you love.
[01:13:14 - 01:13:23] You weren't there.
[01:13:23 - 01:13:30] You didn't come.
[01:13:30 - 01:13:36] I understand.
[01:13:37 - 01:13:41] Something must have happened.
[01:13:41 - 01:13:43] I'm sorry.
[01:13:43 - 01:13:45] I've got two years, Kate.
[01:13:45 - 01:13:46] We can try again.
[01:13:46 - 01:13:48] No, Alex.
[01:13:48 - 01:13:50] It's too late.
[01:13:50 - 01:13:52] It already happened.
[01:13:52 - 01:13:54] It didn't work.
[01:13:54 - 01:13:56] Don't give up on me, Kate.
[01:13:56 - 01:13:58] What about persuasion?
[01:13:58 - 01:14:00] You told me they wait.
[01:14:00 - 01:14:01] They meet again.
[01:14:01 - 01:14:03] They have another chance.
[01:14:03 - 01:14:06] Life is not a book, Alex.
[01:14:06 - 01:14:09] And it can be over in a second.
[01:14:09 - 01:14:12] I was having lunch with my mother at Daily Plaza.
[01:14:12 - 01:14:15] And a man was killed right in front of me.
[01:14:15 - 01:14:17] He died in my arms.
[01:14:17 - 01:14:19] And I thought...
[01:14:19 - 01:14:23] It can end just like that on Valentine's Day.
[01:14:23 - 01:14:27] And I thought about all the people who love him waiting at home
[01:14:27 - 01:14:30] who will never see him again.
[01:14:30 - 01:14:35] And then I thought, what if there is no one?
[01:14:35 - 01:14:41] What if you live your whole life and no one is waiting?
[01:14:41 - 01:14:45] So I drove to the lake house looking for any kind of answer.
[01:14:45 - 01:14:48] And I found you.
[01:14:48 - 01:14:51] And I let myself get lost.
[01:14:51 - 01:14:56] Lost in this beautiful fantasy where time stood still.
[01:14:56 - 01:14:59] But it's not real, Alex.
[01:14:59 - 01:15:04] I have to learn to live the life that I have got.
[01:15:04 - 01:15:08] He's don't write anymore.
[01:15:08 - 01:15:11] Don't try to find me.
[01:15:11 - 01:15:15] Let me let you go.
[01:15:15 - 01:15:18] Let me let you go.
[01:15:45 - 01:15:47] I'm sorry.
[01:15:47 - 01:15:49] Hold on.
[01:15:49 - 01:15:51] Hold on.
[01:15:51 - 01:15:54] Hello?
[01:15:54 - 01:15:57] Hello?
[01:15:57 - 01:16:00] Hello?
[01:16:00 - 01:16:03] Hello?
[01:16:03 - 01:16:07] Hello?
[01:16:07 - 01:16:10] Hello?
[01:16:10 - 01:16:13] Hello?
[01:16:14 - 01:16:16] Hello?
[01:16:16 - 01:16:19] You're fine today.
[01:16:19 - 01:16:23] Come on.
[01:16:23 - 01:16:24] Come on.
[01:16:24 - 01:16:29] How long are you here?
[01:16:29 - 01:16:36] A lighter bar with some friends.
[01:16:36 - 01:16:40] And you're born on your own.
[01:16:40 - 01:16:43] This is good.
[01:16:43 - 01:16:47] And it was really good to hear your voice.
[01:16:47 - 01:16:51] I was surprised how good it was to hear your voice.
[01:16:51 - 01:16:55] So how was your meeting?
[01:16:55 - 01:16:56] Good.
[01:16:56 - 01:16:57] Yeah?
[01:16:57 - 01:16:59] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:59 - 01:17:01] I got the job.
[01:17:01 - 01:17:02] Really?
[01:17:02 - 01:17:03] Yeah.
[01:17:03 - 01:17:05] Congratulations.
[01:17:05 - 01:17:06] I can't imagine that.
[01:17:06 - 01:17:07] You can't imagine that.
[01:17:07 - 01:17:08] Yeah.
[01:17:08 - 01:17:09] Telecom company.
[01:17:09 - 01:17:12] I'll be in House Counsel and pay as well.
[01:17:12 - 01:17:14] And it's here.
[01:17:14 - 01:17:17] In Chicago?
[01:17:17 - 01:17:21] Well, it's great news.
[01:17:29 - 01:17:31] What?
[01:17:36 - 01:17:38] See you there.
[01:17:38 - 01:17:40] Okay.
[01:17:40 - 01:17:42] Alright.
[01:17:42 - 01:17:45] Bye.
[01:17:45 - 01:17:47] I'll see you tomorrow.
[01:17:47 - 01:17:50] Sorry.
[01:17:50 - 01:17:53] Next week, I bet you'll like it.
[01:17:53 - 01:17:56] I can do it.
[01:17:56 - 01:18:00] Again, my Victoria!
[01:18:00 - 01:18:03] And you see this?
[01:19:03 - 01:19:10] I'm gonna come down this weekend.
[01:19:10 - 01:19:13] Don't you miss me a little bit?
[01:19:13 - 01:19:17] Not just a little bit, not a lot.
[01:19:17 - 01:19:18] Okay.
[01:19:18 - 01:19:20] Now I heard you.
[01:19:20 - 01:19:21] Yeah.
[01:19:21 - 01:19:22] Okay.
[01:19:22 - 01:19:26] Um, can I just go back to the hotel?
[01:19:26 - 01:19:27] Yeah.
[01:19:28 - 01:19:30] Now I heard you.
[01:19:30 - 01:19:31] Yeah.
[01:19:31 - 01:19:33] Okay.
[01:19:33 - 01:19:35] I'm gonna have to call you back.
[01:19:35 - 01:19:36] Okay.
[01:19:51 - 01:19:54] Still want to rent a lake house?
[01:19:54 - 01:19:56] It's what Kate wants.
[01:19:57 - 01:20:00] How the hell do you know what Kate wants?
[01:20:00 - 01:20:02] Trust me.
[01:20:14 - 01:20:15] Are you?
[01:20:15 - 01:20:17] Are you?
[01:20:26 - 01:20:29] Yeah, it's not worth a day.
[01:20:56 - 01:20:58] What do you think?
[01:20:58 - 01:21:02] You're fixing, you know?
[01:21:02 - 01:21:04] Why do you keep tweaking the lake house?
[01:21:04 - 01:21:06] Why don't you do your own work?
[01:21:06 - 01:21:08] Because it's hers.
[01:21:08 - 01:21:14] You're uh, talking about the girl from the future.
[01:21:14 - 01:21:16] Kate.
[01:21:16 - 01:21:20] You're still riding with Kate?
[01:21:20 - 01:21:21] No.
[01:21:21 - 01:21:24] Why not?
[01:21:25 - 01:21:27] She asked me not to.
[01:21:27 - 01:21:28] Why?
[01:21:31 - 01:21:33] Time.
[01:21:37 - 01:21:38] Hey, come on.
[01:21:38 - 01:21:40] This is a good thing.
[01:21:40 - 01:21:42] You know, you need a real woman.
[01:21:42 - 01:21:43] A woman?
[01:21:43 - 01:21:44] Hey, me.
[01:21:44 - 01:21:46] Listen.
[01:21:46 - 01:21:49] Listen to me.
[01:21:49 - 01:21:50] Well, it lasted.
[01:21:50 - 01:21:53] She was more real to me than any of that stuff.
[01:21:54 - 01:22:00] She was more real to me than anything I've ever known.
[01:22:00 - 01:22:03] I saw her.
[01:22:03 - 01:22:06] I kissed her.
[01:22:06 - 01:22:09] I love her.
[01:22:12 - 01:22:15] And now she's gone.
[01:22:16 - 01:22:18] She's gone.
[01:22:32 - 01:22:34] Well, and that got squirt through.
[01:22:34 - 01:22:36] First thing.
[01:22:37 - 01:22:40] How could the abs do their full minute abs sheets?
[01:22:40 - 01:22:43] And your potatoes cooking on the top.
[01:22:43 - 01:22:45] It's nice out here.
[01:22:45 - 01:22:47] That's the end.
[01:22:47 - 01:22:49] You have to eat.
[01:22:49 - 01:22:51] Well, you need to eat it.
[01:22:51 - 01:22:53] I'll cook.
[01:22:53 - 01:22:56] I thought you didn't like it, Kate.
[01:22:56 - 01:23:00] No, I don't like it.
[01:23:00 - 01:23:04] But I have a chicken and the ice box, and you're eating it.
[01:23:04 - 01:23:06] I'm not over washing up now.
[01:23:06 - 01:23:07] Really?
[01:23:07 - 01:23:09] Did you turn that town a little bit?
[01:23:09 - 01:23:11] It's a little easy place.
[01:23:11 - 01:23:14] Fun for you and one for you.
[01:24:11 - 01:24:14] I will.
[01:24:17 - 01:24:21] I will.
[01:24:26 - 01:24:29] It could have been not too hard so open.
[01:24:29 - 01:24:33] No taste so similar.
[01:24:33 - 01:24:37] No feeling so envious.
[01:24:41 - 01:25:03] One more time.
[01:25:03 - 01:25:09] One two three go come here.
[01:25:09 - 01:25:18] Come in.
[01:25:33 - 01:25:35] Hello?
[01:25:36 - 01:25:37] Voyage.
[01:25:37 - 01:25:39] What do you think?
[01:25:39 - 01:25:41] This is what I gave up lunch for.
[01:25:41 - 01:25:43] I know it needs work.
[01:25:43 - 01:25:46] Work? What a wrecking ball.
[01:25:46 - 01:25:49] Found an architect who specializes in renovations.
[01:25:49 - 01:25:51] A department for tomorrow.
[01:25:57 - 01:25:58] Ampush.
[01:25:58 - 01:26:00] Come on.
[01:26:00 - 01:26:01] I can't stay in my apartment.
[01:26:01 - 01:26:04] We've been there over a year.
[01:26:04 - 01:26:06] Don't keep looking forward.
[01:26:06 - 01:26:09] What I really don't know,
[01:26:09 - 01:26:10] 21 hours.
[01:26:10 - 01:26:12] Is that good?
[01:26:12 - 01:26:15] It was a time.
[01:26:15 - 01:26:17] It was a new firm.
[01:26:17 - 01:26:20] New is an experience?
[01:26:20 - 01:26:23] No, it was a cheat.
[01:26:26 - 01:26:28] So...
[01:26:28 - 01:26:30] What's up, Footprints?
[01:26:33 - 01:26:34] Hi, Doctor.
[01:26:35 - 01:26:37] He's with the phone.
[01:26:52 - 01:26:54] Oh, by the way.
[01:26:55 - 01:26:58] Don't be Valentine's Day.
[01:26:58 - 01:27:00] Oh, God, Katie.
[01:27:00 - 01:27:02] I didn't get you anything.
[01:27:02 - 01:27:04] I just been...
[01:27:04 - 01:27:06] so swamped.
[01:27:22 - 01:27:23] Whoa!
[01:27:23 - 01:27:25] What is this?
[01:27:26 - 01:27:28] Global warming.
[01:27:29 - 01:27:31] Doctor Forster?
[01:27:31 - 01:27:33] So leave the way.
[01:27:33 - 01:27:35] Is it making it be?
[01:27:37 - 01:27:41] What you really don't want to be?
[01:27:43 - 01:27:46] Leave the way.
[01:27:46 - 01:27:49] Is it making it love?
[01:27:51 - 01:27:53] What you really don't want to be?
[01:27:53 - 01:27:55] I'm not gonna lie. I'm trying to see you get you to your wealth.
[01:27:55 - 01:27:56] Good morning.
[01:27:56 - 01:27:58] Hey, we're in the nest. I've got it back.
[01:27:58 - 01:27:59] Wow.
[01:27:59 - 01:28:01] What you see...
[01:28:01 - 01:28:03] is what we're talking about.
[01:28:03 - 01:28:05] Wow, that's stunning.
[01:28:05 - 01:28:09] So we were able to do it with all the glass panels in the metal smash.
[01:28:09 - 01:28:12] Hey, you want to get a beer after work?
[01:28:12 - 01:28:14] Sorry. I can't.
[01:28:14 - 01:28:17] I'm taking Vanessa out for Valentine's Day.
[01:28:20 - 01:28:22] Wait.
[01:28:22 - 01:28:24] Say that again.
[01:28:24 - 01:28:26] Valentine's Day today.
[01:28:26 - 01:28:27] Taking out Vanessa.
[01:28:27 - 01:28:31] campaigns, the moister, the little chocolate.
[01:28:31 - 01:28:32] It's a day.
[01:28:32 - 01:28:35] February 14th.
[01:28:35 - 01:28:38] February 14th, 2006.
[01:28:38 - 01:28:39] Yeah.
[01:28:39 - 01:28:41] Thank you so much.
[01:28:41 - 01:28:42] Thank you.
[01:28:42 - 01:28:43] Thank you.
[01:28:43 - 01:28:44] Thank you.
[01:28:44 - 01:28:45] I'm going to make sure you're there.
[01:28:45 - 01:28:46] OK, great again.
[01:28:46 - 01:28:48] They were just absolutely beautiful.
[01:28:48 - 01:28:50] Thank you.
[01:28:50 - 01:28:51] Good.
[01:28:51 - 01:28:54] What?
[01:28:54 - 01:28:55] OK.
[01:28:55 - 01:28:57] I get to get back to work.
[01:28:57 - 01:29:02] You did this drawing?
[01:29:02 - 01:29:04] My brother did, actually.
[01:29:04 - 01:29:06] Who's your brother?
[01:29:06 - 01:29:08] Alex Weiler.
[01:29:08 - 01:29:09] Did you know him?
[01:29:12 - 01:29:14] Yeah.
[01:29:14 - 01:29:16] Yeah, I know.
[01:29:19 - 01:29:21] Do you know how I can get in touch with him?
[01:29:21 - 01:29:27] Is he anywhere that I can come?
[01:29:27 - 01:29:29] I'm sorry.
[01:29:29 - 01:29:35] He died two years ago today, actually.
[01:29:40 - 01:29:41] There was an accident.
[01:29:58 - 01:30:00] Where?
[01:30:04 - 01:30:05] OK.
[01:30:08 - 01:30:09] Wait, just stop.
[01:30:09 - 01:30:11] Just stop.
[01:30:11 - 01:30:14] I can't even answer me.
[01:30:14 - 01:30:17] What's the matter?
[01:30:17 - 01:30:18] OK.
[01:30:21 - 01:30:22] OK.
[01:30:27 - 01:30:29] OK.
[01:30:57 - 01:30:59] OK.
[01:31:27 - 01:31:30] 60 degrees on Valentine's Day.
[01:31:30 - 01:31:33] This cannot be Chicago.
[01:31:33 - 01:31:36] The TV says it's global warming.
[01:31:36 - 01:31:38] Nothing wrong with that.
[01:31:38 - 01:31:40] It's a dangerous thing.
[01:31:40 - 01:31:46] Alex, I know why you didn't show up that night.
[01:31:46 - 01:31:51] It was you a daily class of that day.
[01:31:51 - 01:31:54] It was you.
[01:31:54 - 01:31:54] Please don't go.
[01:31:57 - 01:31:59] Just wait.
[01:31:59 - 01:32:03] Please don't look for me.
[01:32:03 - 01:32:04] Don't try to find me.
[01:32:07 - 01:32:08] I love you.
[01:32:11 - 01:32:14] And it's taking me all this time to say it.
[01:32:14 - 01:32:15] But I love you.
[01:32:23 - 01:32:27] And if you still care for me,
[01:32:27 - 01:32:29] wait for me.
[01:32:29 - 01:32:31] Wait with me.
[01:32:31 - 01:32:33] Just wait.
[01:32:33 - 01:32:34] Wait.
[01:32:43 - 01:32:46] Wait two years, Alex.
[01:32:46 - 01:32:49] Come to the lake house.
[01:32:49 - 01:32:50] I'm here.
[01:33:27 - 01:33:30] Are you some good time?
[01:33:33 - 01:33:40] He waited.
[01:33:48 - 01:33:49] He waited.
[01:33:50 - 01:33:52] It's starting now.
[01:35:22 - 01:35:51] I'm very sure this never happened to me before I met you and now I'm sure
[01:35:52 - 01:35:58] This never happened before
[01:36:00 - 01:36:21] Now I see this is the way it's supposed to be I met you and now I see this is the way it should be
[01:36:22 - 01:36:31] This is the way it should be for lovers, they shouldn't go in alone
[01:36:34 - 01:36:38] It's not so good when you're on your own
[01:36:38 - 01:36:51] So come to me now we can be what we want to be
[01:36:53 - 01:37:02] I love you and now I see this is the way it should be
[01:37:02 - 01:37:08] This is the way it should be
[01:37:08 - 01:37:20] This is the way it should be for lovers, they shouldn't go in alone
[01:37:20 - 01:37:27] It's not so good when you're on your own
[01:37:33 - 01:37:46] I'm very sure this never happened to me before I met you and now I'm sure
[01:37:49 - 01:37:58] This never happened before this never happened before
[01:37:58 - 01:38:06] This never happened before
[01:38:28 - 01:38:30] You
