## Phase 2.1: Security & Authentication (Week 1)

### Step 1.1: API Key Authentication
**Goal:** Secure the unified API with token-based authentication

**Implementation:**
- JWT token generation and validation

- `api/middleware/rate_limiter.py`

### Step 1.2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Goal:** Define user roles and permissions

**Roles:**
- `admin` - Full access to all platforms
- `researcher` - Access to Glimpse + read-only Turbo
- `developer` - Access to Echoes + read-only Glimpse
- `analyst` - Read-only access to all platforms

**Implementation:**
- Permission decorators
- Role-based endpoint filtering
- Audit logging for privileged operations

---

## Phase 2.2: Monitoring & Observability (Week 2)

### Step 2.1: Structured Logging
**Goal:** Comprehensive logging across all platforms

**Implementation:**
- Structured JSON logging (loguru or structlog)
- Log aggregation (file-based initially, ELK stack later)
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics logging

**Files to Create:**
- `packages/core/logging/__init__.py`
- `packages/core/logging/logger.py`
- `packages/core/logging/formatters.py`

### Step 2.2: Health Monitoring
**Goal:** Real-time health checks for all platforms

**Implementation:**
- Extended `/health` endpoint with detailed status
- Platform connectivity checks
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Automated alerts for failures

**Metrics to Track:**
- API response times
- Cross-platform call success rates
- Error rates by endpoint
- Active connections

### Step 2.3: Metrics & Analytics
**Goal:** Track usage patterns and performance

**Implementation:**
- Prometheus metrics export
- Custom metrics for cross-platform operations
- Dashboard (Grafana or simple web UI)

---

## Phase 2.3: Production Deployment (Week 3)

### Step 3.1: Environment Configuration
**Goal:** Separate dev/staging/production configs

**Implementation:**
- Environment-specific `.env` files
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- Kubernetes manifests (optional, for scalability)

**Files to Create:**
- `.env.production`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `k8s/` (optional)

### Step 3.2: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal:** Automated testing and deployment

**Implementation:**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing on push
- Deployment to staging/production
- Rollback procedures

**Files to Create:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Step 3.3: Backup & Recovery
**Goal:** Data persistence and disaster recovery

**Implementation:**
- Automated backups of configurations
- State persistence for long-running operations
- Recovery procedures documentation

---

## Phase 2.4: Extended Integrations (Week 4)

### Step 4.1: WebSocket Support
**Goal:** Real-time bidirectional communication

**Implementation:**
- WebSocket endpoint for live updates
- Real-time trajectory streaming from Glimpse
- Live bias detection results from Turbo

**Files to Create:**
- `api/websocket/__init__.py`
- `api/websocket/handlers.py`

### Step 4.2: Batch Processing
**Goal:** Handle large-scale analysis requests

**Implementation:**
- Async task queue (Celery or similar)
- Batch analysis endpoints
- Progress tracking and notifications

### Step 4.3: Plugin System
**Goal:** Extensible architecture for new platforms

**Implementation:**
- Plugin interface definition
- Dynamic plugin loading
- Plugin registry and discovery

**Files to Create:**
- `packages/core/plugins/__init__.py`
- `packages/core/plugins/base.py`
- `packages/core/plugins/registry.py`

---

## Phase 2.5: Use Case Demonstrations (Ongoing)

### Use Case 1: Research-to-Development Pipeline
**Scenario:** Researcher discovers bias pattern in Glimpse â†’ Developer implements fix in Echoes

**Demo:**
1. Glimpse detects trajectory anomaly
2. Unified API routes to Turbo for bias analysis
3. Results sent to Echoes for automated fix suggestion
4. Developer reviews and applies fix

### Use Case 2: Real-Time Collaboration
**Scenario:** Multiple users analyzing same dataset across platforms

**Demo:**
1. User A queries knowledge graph (Echoes)
2. User B runs bias detection (Turbo)
3. User C visualizes trajectory (Glimpse)
4. All results merged in unified dashboard

### Use Case 3: Automated Insights Pipeline
**Scenario:** Continuous monitoring and automated reporting

**Demo:**
1. Scheduled analysis runs across all platforms
2. Results aggregated and stored
3. Automated report generation
4. Alerts for anomalies
