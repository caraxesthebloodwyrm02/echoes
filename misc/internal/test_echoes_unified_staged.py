### Q: How do I configure OpenAI API?
A: Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

### Q: What embedding models are supported?
A: text-embedding-3-large (3072d), text-embedding-3-small (1536d), text-embedding-ada-002 (1536d)

### Q: How does RAG work without FAISS?
A: Uses in-memory cosine similarity with normalized embeddings via NumPy.

### Q: What are the RAG presets?
A: openai-fast (small model), openai-balanced (large model), openai-accurate (large optimized)

### Q: Can I use custom documents?
A: Yes, use the LangChain loader utility for bulk ingestion.
