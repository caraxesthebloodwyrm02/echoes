# 🚀 42CRUNCH OPENAPI SECURITY AUDIT - COMPLETE GUIDE

## 📋 Prerequisites
1. ✅ VS Code with 42Crunch OpenAPI extension installed
2. ✅ FastAPI application running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
3. ✅ OpenAPI specification accessible

## 🎯 Step-by-Step 42Crunch Workflow

### Step 1: Start Your FastAPI Application
\\\ash
cd /e/Projects/Development
source venv/Scripts/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
\\\

### Step 2: Verify API is Running
\\\ash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json
\\\

### Step 3: Open VS Code and Load OpenAPI Spec
1. Open VS Code in your project directory
2. Open the \openapi-spec.json\ file (or create from /openapi.json endpoint)
3. Ensure 42Crunch extension is active (look for 42Crunch icon in status bar)

### Step 4: Run 42Crunch Security Audit

#### Option A: Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
\\\
OpenAPI: API Audit
\\\

#### Option B: Quick Commands
- \OpenAPI: API Scan\ - Fast security scan
- \42Crunch: Export Scan Report file\ - Export scan results
- \42Crunch: Export Audit Report file\ - Export detailed audit

### Step 5: Review Security Findings
- Check the Problems panel for security issues
- Review the audit report for detailed findings
- Look for OWASP API Security Top 10 issues

### Step 6: Fix Security Issues
Common fixes based on your codebase:
- ✅ XML External Entity (XXE) - ALREADY FIXED (defusedxml)
- ✅ Command Injection - ALREADY FIXED (shell=False)
- ✅ Host binding issues - ALREADY FIXED (secure defaults)
- 🔍 Check for authentication/authorization issues
- 🔍 Verify input validation
- 🔍 Review CORS policies

## 🔧 42Crunch Commands Reference

- ✅ Proper input validation
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Secure CORS configuration
- ✅ HTTPS readiness (for production)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

1. **Extension Not Working**
   - Ensure 42Crunch extension is installed and activated
   - Check VS Code output panel for errors
   - Verify internet connection for license checks

2. **API Not Accessible**
   - Confirm FastAPI is running on port 8000
   - Check firewall/antivirus blocking
   - Verify OpenAPI spec is valid JSON

3. **Audit Fails**
   - Check OpenAPI spec format
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Verify API endpoints are properly documented

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ 42Crunch audit completes without critical errors
- ✅ Security report generated successfully
- ✅ No high-severity OWASP API vulnerabilities
- ✅ Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- ✅ Input validation adequate

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Run the audit and share any issues found
2. Export the security report
3. Address any critical security findings
4. Integrate 42Crunch into your CI/CD pipeline
