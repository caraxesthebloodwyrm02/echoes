# Echoes Development Race Track Blueprint
# Inspired by CERN's Hadron Collider visualization as F1 race tracks
# Tracks = Phases/Paths, Car = Solo Operator Process, Engine = Python Tooling

## Race Circuit Layout
### Main Circuit: Echoes Trajectory Race
- **Track 1: Current Position** (Phase 3 MCP Integration)
  - Pit Stop: MCP Client Completion (Week 1)
  - Fuel Check: Alignment Score 0.85
  - Engine: Python MCP Client

- **Track 2: Lumina Integration Lap**
  - Straight: Modify Lumina for Tool Calling
  - Corner: Add Discovery + Mock Tests
  - Safety Car: Incremental to avoid complexity

- **Track 3: GitHub Adapter Sprint**
  - Acceleration: Implement Adapter
  - Apex: End-to-End Tests
  - Overtake: Performance Optimization

- **Track 4: Documentation & Phase 4 Prep**
  - Final Lap: Update Docs + Simulate Phase 4
  - Checkered Flag: Simulation Score >= 0.9

### Optimization Strategy (F1 Race Tactics)
- **Qualifying**: Simulation runs before each lap to set pole position (best alignment)
- **Race Fuel**: Python-only tooling, daily progress (solo operator pace)
- **Pit Strategy**: Break complex corners into smaller stops
- **DRS (Overtake Aid)**: Use existing automation framework as boost

### Race Engineer Notes
- **Car Setup**: Solo operator = lightweight, agile vehicle
- **Tire Strategy**: Soft tires for quick milestones, hard for documentation
- **Weather Conditions**: Monitor risks (complexity, timeline slip)
- **Winning Line**: Complete Phase 3, prepare Phase 4 grid position

This blueprint ensures the most optimized path by visualizing connections, prioritizing solo-feasible increments, and using simulation as qualifying sessions.
