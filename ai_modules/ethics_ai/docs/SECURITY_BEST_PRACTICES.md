# Security Best Practices Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed security best practices for users, administrators, and developers of the Educational Ecosystem Framework.

## User Security Guidelines

### Access Management

#### Token Security
- **Never share access tokens** with anyone, including support staff
- **Store tokens securely** - avoid plaintext storage in code or configuration files
- **Rotate tokens regularly** - change tokens every 30-90 days
- **Report compromised tokens** immediately to security@educational-ecosystem.org

#### Account Protection
- Use strong, unique passwords for any external integrations
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Monitor your access logs for unusual activity
- Log out of shared devices after use

### Data Privacy

#### Information Sharing
- Only provide necessary personal information during registration
- Be cautious about sharing detailed learning patterns or preferences
- Review privacy settings and data collection preferences
- Request data deletion when no longer participating

#### Safe Communication
- Use official channels for sensitive communications
- Avoid sharing personal information in public feedback
- Report suspicious messages or requests for information

## Administrator Security Guidelines

### System Administration

#### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Regular Access Reviews:** Audit user permissions quarterly
- **Session Management:** Implement automatic session timeouts
- **Failed Login Monitoring:** Alert on multiple failed login attempts

#### Data Management
- **Encryption:** Ensure all data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Backup Security:** Secure backup locations and transmission
- **Data Retention:** Follow defined data retention policies
- **Access Logging:** Maintain comprehensive audit trails

### Infrastructure Security

#### Server Security
- Keep operating systems and software updated
- Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Regular security patching and updates

#### Container Security (if using Docker)
- Use official base images only
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Implement resource limits and isolation
- Regular image updates and security scanning

## Developer Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
```python
# ✅ Good: Validate all inputs
def register_user(name: str, role: str):
    valid_roles = ["student", "teacher", "parent", "admin"]
    if role not in valid_roles:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid role: {role}")
    # Process validated input...

# ❌ Bad: No validation
def register_user(name, role):
    # Dangerous - no validation!
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))

# ❌ Bad: String formatting
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

#### Authentication Security
```python
# ✅ Good: Secure token generation
import secrets
import hashlib

def generate_token(user_id: str) -> str:
    token_data = f"{user_id}:{secrets.token_hex(16)}"
    return hashlib.sha256(token_data.encode()).hexdigest()

# ❌ Bad: Weak token generation
def generate_token(user_id: str) -> str:
    return f"token_{user_id}_{random.randint(1, 1000)}"
```

### Dependency Security

#### Package Management
- Use Poetry for dependency management (already implemented)
- Regularly run `poetry audit` for vulnerability scanning
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
- Remove unused dependencies

#### Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Check for dependency vulnerabilities
poetry run safety check

# Security code scanning
poetry run bandit -r .

# License compliance
poetry run pip-licenses --format=markdown > LICENSES.md
```

### Testing Security

#### Security Testing
- Include security test cases in unit tests
- Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection)
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Test authentication and authorization flows

#### Penetration Testing
- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Test with various user roles and permissions
- Validate security controls under load
- Document and track security test results

## Incident Response Procedures

### Detection

#### Monitoring Setup
- Implement comprehensive logging for all user actions
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Monitor system resources and performance
- Regular security log reviews

#### Anomaly Detection
- Unusual access patterns (wrong time zones, multiple locations)
- Unexpected data access or modifications
- Performance anomalies that might indicate attacks
- Authentication failures and suspicious logins

### Response

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Assess Impact:** Determine scope and severity
2. **Contain Threat:** Isolate affected systems
3. **Preserve Evidence:** Maintain logs and system state
4. **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform affected parties as appropriate

#### Investigation Process
1. **Log Analysis:** Review all relevant logs
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how the incident occurred
3. **Impact Assessment:** Determine data and system impact
4. **Evidence Collection:** Gather all relevant information

### Recovery

#### System Restoration
- Restore from clean backups if necessary
- Apply security patches and fixes
- Validate system integrity before returning to production
- Monitor for reoccurrence of the issue

#### Communication
- **Internal Communication:** Keep team informed of status
- **User Communication:** Notify affected users as appropriate
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Report to authorities if required
- **Public Disclosure:** Coordinated disclosure when fixes are available

## Security Tools and Commands

### Development Environment
```bash
# Security scanning
poetry run bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
poetry run safety check --json

# Dependency analysis
poetry run pip-licenses --format=markdown > DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md

# Code quality (includes security checks)
poetry run flake8 . --select=E,W,F,S
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Vulnerability scanning
docker scan your-image:latest

# Container security
kubectl audit --output=json

# Network security
nmap -sV -p- your-server.com
```
