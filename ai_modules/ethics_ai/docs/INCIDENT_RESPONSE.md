## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment

#### Detection Methods
- **Automated Monitoring:** Security tools and alerting systems
- **User Reports:** Stakeholders reporting suspicious activity
- **System Logs:** Analysis of access and error logs
- **External Notifications:** Reports from security researchers

#### Initial Assessment Steps
1. **Verify Incident:** Confirm the reported issue is legitimate
2. **Classify Severity:** Assign appropriate severity level
3. **Assess Impact:** Determine scope and affected systems/users
4. **Document Initial Findings:** Create incident record

#### Assessment Checklist
- [ ] What type of incident occurred?
- [ ] When did it start? How was it detected?
- [ ] What systems/data are affected?
- [ ] Who reported it? Are they authorized?
- [ ] Is this a known vulnerability or attack pattern?
- [ ] What is the potential impact?

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Short-Term Containment
- **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect from network if necessary
- **Disable Compromised Accounts:** Temporarily suspend access
- **Preserve Evidence:** Create forensic copies of affected systems
- **Implement Workarounds:** Provide alternative access methods

#### Long-Term Containment
- **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Apply security fixes
- **Update Access Controls:** Strengthen authentication and authorization
- **Monitor for Spread:** Watch for lateral movement or data exfiltration
- **Communicate Status:** Keep stakeholders informed

### Phase 3: Eradication

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Technical Investigation:** Identify how the incident occurred
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Find and document security weaknesses
- **Attack Vector Analysis:** Understand the method of compromise
- **Impact Analysis:** Determine what data or systems were affected

#### Remediation Steps
1. **Remove Threats:** Eliminate malware, unauthorized access, etc.
2. **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Apply security updates and fixes
3. **Strengthen Controls:** Implement additional security measures
4. **Validate Fixes:** Test that vulnerabilities are resolved

### Phase 4: Recovery

#### System Restoration
- **Restore from Backups:** If clean backups are available
- **Rebuild Systems:** If compromise is too extensive
- **Gradual Rollout:** Phased return to production
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring during recovery

#### Service Restoration
- **User Communication:** Notify users of service restoration
- **Functionality Testing:** Validate all features work correctly
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure system performance is maintained
- **Security Validation:** Confirm security controls are effective

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned

#### Post-Incident Review
- **Timeline Reconstruction:** Create detailed incident timeline
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify why the incident occurred
- **Impact Assessment:** Document actual vs. potential impact
- **Response Effectiveness:** Evaluate response procedures

#### Documentation and Improvement
- **Incident Report:** Complete documentation for records
- **Process Improvements:** Update procedures based on findings
- **Training Updates:** Incorporate lessons into security training
- **Control Enhancements:** Implement additional preventive measures
