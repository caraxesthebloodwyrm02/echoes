# Phase Simulation and Alignment Assessment

## Overview
The Phase Simulator evaluates development phases against user vision (Python-only, single-operator workflow, no JS/TS/Node). It scores alignment and provides feedback to ensure trajectories stay on course.

## Usage
1. Define phase in JSON (e.g., `phase3_mcp_plan.json`).
2. Run: `python run_simulator.py <plan_file>`.
3. Review scores, recommendations, and risks.

## Factors Assessed
- **Toolchain**: Python-only compliance.
- **Complexity**: Suitability for solo work.
- **Time Estimate**: Realistic for single operator.
- **Solo Feasibility**: Workload distribution.
- **Vision Alignment**: Match with automation/Python focus.

## Integration
- Use before planning phases to validate alignment.
- Incorporate feedback into phase adjustments.
- Keeps workflow streamlined and vision-aligned.
