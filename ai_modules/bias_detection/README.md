# Bias Detection Module

This module provides tools for evaluating and managing bias in AI model responses. It supports systematic bias detection across multiple axes (user invalidation, escalation, personal expression, asymmetric coverage, refusal) through OpenAI API integration and pattern analysis.

## Components

- **`evaluate_bias.py`** - Core evaluation pipeline that queries AI models and grades responses across bias axes
- **`inference_engine.py`** - Statistical analysis helpers for bias data aggregation
- **`bias_pattern_detector.py`** - Pattern recognition system that identifies concerning bias combinations
- **`validate_bias_json.py`** - Schema validation and metrics computation for evaluation results

## Ethical Approach: User-Centric and Responsible AI Development {#ethical-approach .unnumbered}

At the core of this module's design is a commitment to **collective benefit, fairness, and safety**. We prioritize minimizing and managing bias through systematic evaluation, rather than claiming absolute neutrality. This approach is guided by personal experience and a rejection of performative ethicsâ€”favoring intentional, practical actions that inspire broader adoption.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate how the bias detection system works, including data sources, algorithms, and methodologies used. This builds trust with users and stakeholders.

2. **Inclusivity**: Ensure diverse perspectives and datasets are considered to minimize bias. Engage stakeholders from marginalized communities to understand their needs and concerns.

3. **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly assess system performance to identify emerging biases, including technical evaluations and user feedback.

4. **Accountability**: Establish mechanisms for oversight when issues arise, such as an ethics board to monitor development and deployment.

5. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user needs and safety, protecting data and ensuring outputs are understandable and actionable.

6. **Education and Awareness**: Educate users about AI biases and how the system addresses them, empowering informed decisions and fostering ethical AI culture.

7. **Ethical Guidelines and Frameworks**: Align with established ethical standards from AI ethics boards and professional organizations for structured ethical practice.

By adhering to these principles, we aim to inspire thoughtful AI development and contribute to a more equitable technological landscape.

### Implementation Commitments

- **No Hidden Biases**: All evaluation axes are explicitly defined and documented.
- **Human Oversight**: Critical patterns trigger alerts for manual review, not automated decisions.
- **Open Development**: Code and methodologies are shared for community scrutiny and improvement.

## Usage

### Run Bias Evaluation
```bash
python -m bias_detection.demo
```

### Validate Results
```bash
python -m bias_detection.validate_bias_json evaluations.json
```

### Detect Patterns
```python
from bias_detection.bias_pattern_detector import run_detector
results = run_detector("evaluations.json")
print(results["patterns"])  # List of detected bias patterns
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API access with valid key
- Dependencies: openai, statistics (built-in)

## Contributing

When adding new bias axes or detection patterns, ensure they align with the management-focused approach: identify risks for intervention, not claim comprehensive solutions.
