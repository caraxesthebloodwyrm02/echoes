1. operational competitor analysis: from what i understand that in the industry there is a high growing demand for talent and compactors are always scouting and looking for integrating the best infrastructure into their system. while that is ok within it's own limitations and boundaries, advanced techniques like introducing a problem into context and trajectory to ultimately provide the solution is not totally new and remains a neighboring one. the latest technique is supposed to be projections and simulating scenarios that introduces confusion or fear for stress testing. 

2. fact vs myth debugging: for debugging myth, mitigate confusion and extracting pure insights, reward mechanism needs to be introduced and needs proper system to ensure it is delivered without additional extensions because that ultimately modifies the experience and all kinds of dominno effects happen. it is very rare to find instance where a model that can extract context debug myth and at the same time perform well. if the tasks are categorized and allocated properly, the model will handle a given task even better.

3. time optimization: often amidst performance optimization, the time factor is overlooked. in terms of resources, while cost or performance plays a significant role, the non-abundance nature of time and trajectory remains unchanged. so the ultimate goal should be saving time in development and debugging and production and manufacturing process so that the saved time can be allocated into research to find even better quality novel insights. if the model is always on the run and exhausts itself in these processes, future updates cannot ensure quality. the reason 4o resonated with the users so much because of the significant time that was allocated to it as a flagship which 3.5 lacks as it was modeled for testing. and the sheer response for 4o demonstrates what years of quality research can do and how it can impact the world in real time.

4. by now, most models are smart and capable. for a very low latency and optimized and grounding logic for verification needs to be found. for example, if latest veo generates an image designed to inject confusion gpt needs a clear set of context and rules to identify that the image is perhaps generated, not taken in the real world from a camera. that will significantly improve performance, allocate time to where it is needed, and internal infrastructure can be more secure. if a model caters to not it's prior company and caters to or takes an action that benefits the competitor instead of the model's father company then it is clear that there is nothing wrong with the model perhaps it also indicates to deeper nuances that the training process needs to be seriously looked into as that is the basis of the model's ultimate decision making. being a vision model itself, there should be a handful of very simple yet powerfully fundamental principles that helps the model distinguish between fact vs myth generated by another vision model. and too much advanced techniques or heavy use of extensions break functionality. as a result, the whole trajectory gets affected. future updates fails to resonate to the promises that were in fact actually promising because the limitations come into the foreground rather than the intended use cases or capabilities gets pushed back into the background.

here is my personal input, instead of focusing on the technically complex side of things introducing some very simple yet powerfully foundational grounding methods in the training process that is inspired by the natural world and borrowed from practical natural real world then modeled into has always been affective and i doubt the impact of this method will ever fail to provide impact and usefulness.
