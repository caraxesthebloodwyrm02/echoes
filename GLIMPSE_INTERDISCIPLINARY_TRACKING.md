### Cross-Domain Analogies
**Purpose:** Facilitate understanding across fields

**Examples:**
| Concept (Origin) | Analogy (Target Field) | Insight |
|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Predictive processing (Neurosci) | Bayesian inference (AI) | Prior beliefs + evidence → perception |
| Quantum measurement (Physics) | Observer effect (Philosophy) | Interaction changes observed system |
| Retrieval-augmented generation (AI) | Working memory (Neurosci) | Context retrieval for task execution |

**Updated:** Each advisory board meeting

### Integrative Workshops
**Frequency:** Once per phase (optional)
**Duration:** Half-day

**Format:**
1. **Cross-Pollination:** Each expert presents core concepts from their field
2. **Problem Framing:** Reframe project challenges through each lens
3. **Synthesis:** Identify common patterns and insights
4. **Application:** How insights inform project design
