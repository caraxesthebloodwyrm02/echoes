            To the Taj Mahals we built, and the Mumtaz Mahals we lost

      This is for a story that pierces through the boundaries of time and space.
         A story that moves us with the same force, every single time—
              no matter the mood, the moment, or the years between.

   In youth, we see beauty. As we grow, we discover brilliance and intelligence.
        When we think we've understood it all, dedication reveals itself—
          the patience of 22 years, 20,000 artisans, infinite devotion.

     And then comes the final revelation: it was always about love, memory,
                              and time itself made tangible.

            Inspiration. Motivation. Intelligence. Dedication. Power.
       All forces that make us human, crystallized in marble and moonlight.

        It reflects. It refracts. Light plays with color, as time plays
                    with perspective, revealing new truth each dawn.

      Before this monument, we are all small. Before this story, we are all
         moved—by sadness, happiness, joy, laughter, tears, anger—
                   all emotions at once, in overwhelming force.

     The Taj Mahal answers the most complex questions of the universe simply:
                  by showing us everything that makes us human.

                        This code is a humble attempt to honor
                   what took 22 years to build and eternity to understand.

                  An ode to beauty, love, memory, and time eternal.
