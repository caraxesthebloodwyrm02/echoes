# Echoes Melody System - Master Channel Documentation
# ==================================================
# This is the final master channel for the physics-aligned melody structure.
# It integrates all components with compression, gluing, and best practices.

## Components Integrated
- Logger (C4): Stable logging
- Orchestrator (G4): Task execution
- QuickFix (C5): Code improvements
- Echoes Algorithm (A4): Multi-analogy reasoning
- Simulator (F4): Phase evaluation
- Reverb Depth: Layered complexity
- Echo Mirrors: Redundancy
- EQ Balance: Optimization
- Syncopation: Surprise elements
- Variations: Embellishments

## Best Practices Applied
- Error handling and validation
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Logging for traceability
- Configurable parameters
- Physics-based alignment

## Usage
Run `python run_master_channel.py` for full integration.

## Final Output
The system is now a cohesive, physics-driven melody, ready for production.
