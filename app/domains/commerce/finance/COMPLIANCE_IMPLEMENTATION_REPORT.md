## Security Architecture

### Data Flow Security

```
User Input → Validation → PII Detection → Encryption → Storage
                      ↓
                Audit Logging → Compliance Monitoring
```

### API Security Layers

```
Rate Limiting → Input Validation → Authentication → Authorization → Processing
                      ↓
                Audit Logging → Security Monitoring
```

### Encryption Strategy

```
Data Classification:
├── Public: No encryption
├── Internal: Basic encryption
├── Confidential: Strong encryption
└── Restricted: Maximum protection + PII detection
```
