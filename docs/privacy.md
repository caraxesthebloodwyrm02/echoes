- Performance metrics: 1 year

## Data Security & Protection

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: All stored data encrypted using AES-256
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission

## Anonymization & De-identification

### Anonymization Techniques

**Student Data:**
- Hashing of direct identifiers (student IDs, names)
- Aggregation of behavioral data
- Removal of geographic and demographic details

**Analytics Data:**
- Statistical disclosure control
- K-anonymity for small datasets
- Differential privacy for aggregate reporting

### De-identification Process

1. Remove direct identifiers (names, IDs, contact info)
2. Generalize quasi-identifiers (age ranges, not exact ages)
3. Add noise to prevent re-identification
4. Verify through privacy risk assessment

## Third-Party Services

### Approved Third Parties

**Hugging Face Hub:**
- Model storage and inference only
- No personal data shared
- Models vetted for safety and bias

**Analytics Services:**
- Anonymized, aggregated data only
- No individual student data
