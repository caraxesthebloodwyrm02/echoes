## Session scaffold: gaps and focus

Focus areas
- Pause interpretation in STS interactions (semantic pause metrics, turn-taking, timing).
- Workflow routines: mixture-of-experts, parallel macro layers, reproducible runs.
- Templates and prompt caching: score, chain, and reuse high-quality prompts.

Real-world references (public)
- Joe Rogan Experience — Trump pre-election episode: early exchange on "I have no idea..." → rapid context shift.
- Lex Fridman — Elon Musk: "I don't think anybody would want to be me" → empathetic pivot.

Outcomes
- Data artifacts in data/podcasts/ with timestamps, context, and pause annotations.
- A seedable pause model scaffold (speech/pause_model.py) with tests.
- Routines Glimpse implementing the 10-step workflow.
- Prompt templates and a simple caching Glimpse with similarity search.

Constraints
- Public/transcribed materials only; respect licensing.
- Fixed seeds; cross-platform execution (Windows-friendly).
- Modular: does not alter existing steam-Glimpse dynamics behavior.
