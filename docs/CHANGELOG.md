# 📋 Changelog - Educational Ecosystem

## Version 2.0.0 - Natural Role Inference (2025-09-30)

### 🎯 Major Improvement: Implicit Role Detection

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Removed explicit "Select your role" question
- ✅ Added natural conversational questions
- ✅ Implemented intelligent role inference
- ✅ Enhanced data logging with inference details

### 🔄 Before vs After

#### **Before (v1.0.0):**
```
System: "Select your role:"
  1. Student
  2. Teacher
  3. Parent
  4. Administrator
  5. Community Member

User: [Picks number]
```

#### **After (v2.0.0):**
```
System: "What brings you to our ecosystem today?"
  1. I'm here to learn and explore
  2. I'm here to teach or facilitate
  3. I'm here to support my child
  4. I'm here to manage or oversee
  5. I'm here to contribute to the community

System: "How do you typically spend your day here?"
  [5 behavioral options]

System: "What interests you most about this space?"
  [5 value-based options]

→ System automatically infers role with confidence score
```

### ✨ New Features

#### **1. Intelligent Inference Engine**
- Scoring system (3+2+1 points across 3 questions)
- Confidence calculation (score/6)
- Transparent logging of inference process
- Handles ambiguous cases gracefully

#### **2. Rich Data Capture**
```json
{
  "inference_data": {
    "purpose": "User's answer to question 1",
    "daily_activity": "User's answer to question 2",
    "interest": "User's answer to question 3",
    "scores": {
      "student": 6,
      "teacher": 0,
      "parent": 0,
      "administrator": 0,
      "community_member": 0
    },
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "inferred_role": "student"
  }
}
```

#### **3. Returning User Optimization**
- Name-based lookup (fuzzy matching)
- Single question for returning users
- Instant profile loading
- No repeated inference

#### **4. Helper Functions**
- `_find_user_by_name()`: Fuzzy name matching
- `_infer_role()`: Scoring and inference logic
- Enhanced session logging
