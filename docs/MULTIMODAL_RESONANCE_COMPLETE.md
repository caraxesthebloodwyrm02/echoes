### 🎵 Multimodal Resonance Glimpse (NEW)

#### Core Innovation: File Extension Grounding Vectors
The system now understands files through their extensions as grounding vectors that define processing modality, resonance frequency, and cross-modal potential.

#### Modality Vector Mappings
```python
# Vision Modalities
.png  → vision (resonance: 0.85, quality: 0.9)    # High-quality lossless vision
.webp → vision (resonance: 0.75, quality: 0.8)    # Modern web format
.jpg  → vision (resonance: 0.70, quality: 0.6)    # Compressed vision

# Text Modalities  
.txt  → text (resonance: 0.60, quality: 0.5)      # Pure notes
.md   → text (resonance: 0.80, quality: 0.7)      # Structured documents
.pdf  → vision (resonance: 0.65, quality: 0.7)    # Text through vision processing

# Audio Modalities
.mp3  → audio (resonance: 0.60, quality: 0.5)     # Compressed audio
.wav  → audio (resonance: 0.90, quality: 0.95)    # High-quality nuanced audio

# Structured/Geometric Modalities
.xlsx → geometric (resonance: 0.70, quality: 0.8) # Text with geometric structure
.csv  → structured (resonance: 0.60, quality: 0.6) # Tabular data
```
