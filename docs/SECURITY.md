## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**ðŸš¨ Security vulnerabilities should NOT be reported through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities using one of these secure channels:

1. **Email:** security@educational-ecosystem.org (Preferred)
2. **Encrypted Report:** Use our [PGP Key](#pgp-key) for sensitive reports
3. **Private Disclosure:** Contact maintainers directly via private message

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Vulnerability Description:** Clear explanation of the security issue
- **Affected Version(s):** Which versions are impacted
- **Reproduction Steps:** How to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Potential Impact:** What could happen if exploited
- **Suggested Fix:** Optional - your recommended solution
- **Environment Details:** OS, Python version, deployment setup

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours of report
2. **Initial Assessment:** Within 48 hours
3. **Status Updates:** Weekly during investigation
4. **Resolution Timeline:**
   - Critical vulnerabilities: 7-14 days
   - High severity: 14-30 days
   - Medium severity: 30-60 days
   - Low severity: Next release cycle

### Vulnerability Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise | 7-14 days |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, major functionality break | 14-30 days |
| **Medium** | Limited data exposure, partial functionality loss | 30-60 days |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations | Next release |

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

This system handles sensitive educational data including:

- **Personal Information:** Names, contact details, roles

**Data Protection Measures:**
- All personal data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access logging for audit trails
- Data retention policies (7 years for educational records)
- GDPR compliance for EU stakeholders

### Authentication & Access Control

- **Multi-Level Access:** Visitor â†’ Student â†’ Instructor â†’ Admin
- **Token-Based Authentication:** SHA-256 hashed access tokens
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling with timeouts
- **Audit Trails:** Complete access logging for compliance

### Equipment & Physical Security

- **Asset Tracking:** Unique IDs for all equipment
- **Access Logging:** Check-in/check-out audit trails
- **Damage Reporting:** Incident tracking and resolution
- **Maintenance Records:** Equipment lifecycle management

## Security Best Practices
