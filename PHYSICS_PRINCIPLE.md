# Echoes Physics Principle
# ========================
# Root Principle: Physics as Pillar for Reasoning and Operations
#
# All development in Echoes operates as a physical system, governed by fundamental physics principles.
# This compresses complexities into actionable insights, ensuring stable, efficient, and aligned trajectories.
#
# Core Physics Laws Applied:
# 1. Conservation of Energy: Minimize effort waste; optimize for sustainable workflows.
# 2. Forces and Fields: Alignment as magnetic attraction, complexity as repulsive force.
# 3. Trajectories and Dynamics: Development as motion; optimize paths for velocity (progress) and momentum (consistency).
# 4. Equilibrium and Stability: Achieve balanced states (e.g., alignment score equilibrium); avoid chaotic oscillations.
# 5. Precision and Measurement: Like quantum precision, measure and calibrate every component for accuracy.
# 6. Systems Integration: Holistic view; components interact like particles in a field, maintaining coherence.
#
# Application in Code:
# - Every module/function embodies these laws.
# - Algorithms simulate physical dynamics (e.g., force calculations for alignment).
# - Workflows conserve "energy" (effort) while maximizing "work" (output).
# - Feedback loops maintain system equilibrium.
#
# This principle scaffolds all building: from code design to planning, standing on physics for robust, insightful operations.
