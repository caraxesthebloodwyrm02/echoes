Add a separate job to run contract tests against a deployed staging service using real domain-stub endpoints. 8 \u2014 Quick integration checklist (pragmatic) Drop api/schemas.py and api/routes.py into your api/ package. Wire into main FastAPI app. Add core/validation/provenance_enforcer.py and register middleware in app startup. Add tests under tests/ and ensure requirements.txt contains pytest, fastapi, httpx. Add CI file to .github/workflows/ci.yml. Implement persistent HIL feedback queue (e.g., Redis or Kafka) and a labeling UI before connecting to retrain flows. Implement action whitelist and approval workflow in the orchestrator before removing dry-run default. 9 \u2014 Minimal acceptance criteria (for merging) All new tests pass locally and in CI. Provenance validation endpoint rejects assertions with empty provenance. Agent /execute honors dry_run=True and performs no side-effects. Kill endpoint returns killed status and is wired to orchestration layer (stub ok for initial PR). Lint and type checks pass.</p>"},{"location":"Fixing%20Markdown%20Linting/#planner-response_2","title":"Planner Response","text":"<p>I'll help integrate these components into the codebase.

safety gaps that must be closed before domain rollout. Strengths Clean modular structure that supports clear ownership and incremental delivery. Domain cards map directly to implementable classes and APIs. Cross-domain fusion and artisan commerce connector are differentiators vs typical single-domain ML products. Ethics/validation core is included early. Major gaps &amp; risks Data provenance and RAG traceability not enforced. Risk: hallucinations and legal exposure. No explicit human-in-the-loop (HIL) feedback pipeline from users\u2192labeling\u2192retrain. Risk: quality stagnation and misalignment. Privacy/federation missing for biomedical and personal-finance flows (HIPAA/GDPR/FISMA). Risk: compliance fines and loss of enterprise customers. Model selection, routing, and explainability not instrumented. Risk: opaque behavior, inability to debug or defend decisions. Insufficient guardrails for autonomous agents and orchestration (side-effects, write actions). Risk: destructive automation. No cost/energy metering for heavy simulations (physics, retraining). Risk: runaway spend. IP/ownership and provenance for generated art and marketplace flows absent. Risk: creator disputes. Security posture (secrets, dependency scanning, tenancy isolation) not specified. Risk: breach or data leak. Novelty &amp; industry fit Novel: domain fusion (science \u2192 commerce \u2192 arts) and artisan-to-market connector. That combination is rare and promising. Competitive challenge: physics/biomed translational features require domain partnerships and curated datasets to be credible. Market readiness: commerce features (UBI sim, job matching) could attract civic and NGO pilots quickly. Technical risk: multiplanetary physics sims need specialist validation and high compute; treat as research track. Concrete priority recommendations (short list) Add mandatory provenance objects to all generated assertions (source, snippet, timestamp, license). Implement a HIL feedback queue and labeling pipeline before any production retrain. Capture user corrections with metadata. Build a privacy/federated option for biomedical and finance modules (local inference, differential privacy, consent ledger). Create an Agent Safety Layer: dry-run default, circuit breakers, explicit side-effect whitelist, human-approve for destructive actions. Add telemetry for model routing, confidence, abandonment, and feature-level cost. Surface in CI gates. Define IP and attribution flows for arts outputs and marketplace interactions. Harden infra: secrets management, SCA (dependency scanning), tenancy/isolation, data-at-rest encryption, rate limits. Budget and energy meter for heavy experiments; add cost alerts and quota enforcement. Suggested immediate milestones (first three sprints) Sprint 0 (1 week): repo scaffolding, secrets + SCA, provenance schema, ethics validator placeholder. Sprint 1 (2 weeks): implement provenance enforcement, basic HIL feedback capture, API contract for domain cards. Sprint 2 (2 weeks): Agent Safety Layer (dry-run, kill-switch), model-routing telemetry, CI checks for drift/cost alerts. Testing &amp; validation checklist (must-have) Unit tests for provenance and redaction. Integration tests for HIL flow and retrain pipeline with synthetic labels. Security tests: SAST, SCA, infra secrets leak scan. Compliance checklist: HIPAA/GDPR mapping for biomedical and finance endpoints. Chaos test for agent orchestration (simulate third-party failures and ensure graceful degradation). KPIs to track from day 1 False positive/negative rate for safety filters. Time from user feedback \u2192 labeled \u2192 deployed model delta. Model confidence vs. human override rate. Cost per feature (compute $ / inference / retrain). User abandonment after suggestion (engagement loss signal). Quick wins to increase credibility Partner with one verified data source for each science subdomain (PubMed or similar) and wire provenance. Launch the artisan connector as an MVP matching 50 local crafts to opportunities using semantic matching. Expose model variant and confidence in API responses for transparency. Final verdict The plan is strategically strong and has market-differentiating ideas. Prioritize provenance, HIL, privacy, and agent safety before broad public or biomedical deployment. Proceed with iterative delivery: ship low-risk commerce/art MVPs while maturing science/physics research tracks with domain partners.[Snippet
