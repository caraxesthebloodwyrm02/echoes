## Trajectory-Aligned Features

Based on analysis of successful execution trajectories, the following enhancements have been implemented:

### 🏗️ **Ecosystem Monitoring System**
- **Plant-based metaphors**: Roots (core), Branches (features), Leaves (utilities)
- **Continuous health assessment** with automated stressor detection
- **GATE validation** against trojan horses (security, quality, dependency checks)
- **Endpoint vulnerability protection** using vector analysis

### 🔍 **Security & Validation Layer**
- **Detector system** with shadow mode, human approvals, and audit trails
- **Multi-tier detection**: INFO/WARN/BLOCK with configurable thresholds
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical operations
- **7-day shadow mode evaluation** for safe deployment testing

### 📊 **Continuous Monitoring & Feedback**
- **Performance benchmarking** against established thresholds
- **Automated feedback collection** from monitoring, tests, and user input
- **Trend analysis** and improvement recommendations
- **Real-time health scoring** (0-100 ecosystem health metric)

### 🧩 **Modular Architecture**
- **Package separation**: core/, integrations/, monitoring/, security/, utils/
- **Schema-based data structures** with Pydantic validation
- **Clear separation of concerns** following trajectory patterns
- **Configurable components** with proper abstraction

## Python Toolchain

This project uses Python 3.12.x as the baseline for all applications. Dependencies are managed with Poetry for reproducible environments.

### Setup

```bash
# Install Poetry (if not already installed)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies
poetry install  # For development (includes all groups)
poetry install --only main  # For runtime only

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell

# Or run commands directly
poetry run python your_script.py
poetry run pytest
```

### Dependency Groups

- `main`: Core runtime dependencies
- `dev`: Development tooling (testing, linting, docs)
- `diarisation`: Optional speech processing (requires torch)

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov

# Run specific test types
poetry run pytest -m unit        # Fast unit tests
poetry run pytest -m e2e         # End-to-end tests
poetry run pytest -m slow        # Slow tests (may be skipped)
```

### Code Quality

Pre-commit hooks are configured for automatic code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Install hooks
poetry run pre-commit install

# Run manually
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Formatters & Lint Workflow

Use Black, isort, and autoflake locally to keep formatting and imports clean:

```bash
# Install/upgrade tools (already in dev dependencies)
poetry install --with dev

# Format code (Black)
poetry run black .

# Sort imports (isort)
poetry run isort .

# Remove unused imports/variables (autoflake)
poetry run autoflake --in-place --remove-all-unused-imports --remove-unused-variables -r .
```

Run these before committing if pre-commit highlights issues.

### Demo Loop Guards

Some interactive/demo scripts can loop while waiting for model/tool output. To
avoid accidental infinite loops during development, a bounded iteration guard is
used (e.g., `MAX_ROUNDS`) in `examples/Untitled-1.py`:

```python
MAX_ROUNDS = 20
for round_idx in range(MAX_ROUNDS):
    # call model / process tool calls
    ...
else:
    print("[WARN] Maximum iterations reached without terminating. Check tool behavior.")
```

Adjust the limit to suit your use case when running longer sessions.

### Core Utilities

The project uses centralized utilities from `packages.core`:

- **Logging**: `get_logger(name)` for consistent logging across modules
- **Configuration**: Pydantic-based settings with `.env` support
- **Schemas**: Typed data models for podcasts, prompts, and cache entries

### Trajectory-Aligned Features Usage

#### Ecosystem Monitoring
```bash
# Run ecosystem health assessment
poetry run python -c "from Q4.drucker_management import EcosystemManager; em = EcosystemManager(); print(em.operate_gate())"

# Continuous monitoring (runs every hour)
poetry run python -c "from monitoring.continuous_monitor import start_continuous_monitoring; start_continuous_monitoring()"
```

#### Detector System
```bash
# Run detectors in shadow mode for testing
poetry run python detectors/shadow_runner.py

# View detector dashboard (requires dash)
poetry run python detectors/dashboard.py

# Manual detection processing
poetry run python -c "from detectors import BaseDetector, DetectionTier; detector = BaseDetector('test'); result = detector.process({'data': 'test'}); print(result)"
```

#### Feedback System
```bash
# Generate feedback analysis report
poetry run python -c "from monitoring.feedback_mechanism import export_feedback_report; export_feedback_report('feedback_report.json')"

# Collect user feedback
poetry run python -c "from monitoring.feedback_mechanism import collect_user_feedback; collect_user_feedback('Great new features!', 'The ecosystem monitoring is very helpful', 'user_experience')"
```

#### JSON Schema Validation
```bash
# Validate JSON structure
poetry run python validate_json_structure.py

# Use PodcastData schema
poetry run python -c "from packages.core.schemas import PodcastData, PodcastEvent; event = PodcastEvent(timestamp_start_s=0.0, timestamp_end_s=3.25, utterance='Test', label='rhetorical'); data = PodcastData(podcast='Test', episode_title='Test', source='Test', events=[event]); print(data.model_dump_json())"
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch like `feat/centralize-utilities`
2. Make changes using atomic commits (e.g., `feat: add centralized logging module`)
3. Run trajectory tests: `poetry run pytest tests/test_trajectory_scenarios.py`
4. Run ecosystem monitoring: `poetry run python -c "from monitoring.continuous_monitor import run_monitoring_cycle; print(run_monitoring_cycle())"`
5. Run tests/CI after each major change; ensure coverage >=80%
6. Commit changes
7. Create pull request

### Documentation

Generate documentation with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/docs.txt
cd docs && make html
```
