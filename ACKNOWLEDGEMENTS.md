Echoes Platform pays tribute to Pink Floyd for their timeless music and inspiration. This acknowledgment steers clear of political and controversial aspects, focusing purely on the music that continues to inspire and tour globally.

Special acknowledgment to Sir David Gilmour, whose voice cuts through the noise, keeping the spirit alive through music. His rare ability to tell stories and express emotion through guitar solos is electrifying.

A heartfelt mention to Syd Barrett for inspiring Pink Floyd, which led to the creation of the "Wish You Were Here" album and the track "Shine On You Crazy Diamond." These works have had a profound impact on my life, contributing to the birth of the Echoes platform.
