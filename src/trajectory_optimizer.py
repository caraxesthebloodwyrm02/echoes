"""Trajectory Optimization: Data-Driven vs Fast Compounding Analysis.

This module implements two competing optimization strategies:

1. **Data-Driven Analysis (DDA):**
   - High attention/focus at each decision point
   - Analyzes all available paths before choosing
   - Slower but more accurate per-step decisions
   - Higher cognitive load

2. **Fast Compounding (FC):**
   - Low attention/focus per decision (fast context)
   - Makes quick decisions based on accumulated experience
   - Compounds efficiency over longer trajectories
   - Lower cognitive load, learns from momentum

Key Insight: FC may fail early but compounds exponentially over time,
while DDA maintains consistent quality but with diminishing returns.
