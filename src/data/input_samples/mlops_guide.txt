Machine learning operations (MLOps) involve the practices, tools, and processes that enable the reliable deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models in production environments. This includes model versioning, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and performance monitoring.

Key components of MLOps include:
1. Data management and versioning
2. Model training and validation pipelines
3. Automated deployment and scaling
4. Performance monitoring and alerting
5. Model retraining and updating workflows
6. Collaboration and governance frameworks

Modern MLOps platforms integrate with popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, providing tools for experiment tracking, model registry, and automated deployment. Containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are commonly used to ensure reproducible and scalable deployments.
