# This trajectory is complete. We have successfully built a robust, context-aware API call system that is integrated with the Glimpse trajectory and can interact with the codebase through multi-step tool use.

# This was a fantastic exercise in building a resilient agentic workflow. We navigated numerous challenges, from simple syntax errors to complex instruction-following and intent recognition problems, and solved them through iterative refinement of both the code and the prompts.

# The final system is a powerful demonstration of how to build AI that is not just a passive tool but an active participant in the development process, capable of reasoning about and interacting with its own environment.

MODEL SAYS:
The `GuardrailMiddleware` class is designed to enforce security protocols defined in documentation. It uses a rate limiter to control request frequency an
d validates incoming requests to ensure they adhere to specified security standards. This includes checking for the presence and types of certain fields in the request body and potentially applying additional validation rules.                                                                                  --- Final Answer ---
