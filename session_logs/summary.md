## Last session summary

The steam-engine-dynamics project completed its medium-priority items and stabilized the codebase. Tests were expanded with parameterization and fixed seeds, filenames were standardized, and quickstart/demo artifacts were verified. A previously failing stability test in tests/test_governor.py was resolved by making the stability metric in ResonanceGovernor scale-aware, improving robustness across parameter ranges. Continuous Integration was hardened: a Windows-friendly workflow was added/updated to handle C# runner exit codes deterministically. The workflow sets SKIP_HTTP_PROBE=1 to bypass network probes in CI and ALLOW_FAKE_JAVA=1 to acknowledge placeholder Java binaries without attempting execution, eliminating spurious failures on hosted runners. Documentation was updated, including CONTRIBUTING.md, an index note, and VERSION bumped to 1.1.0. The feature branch was merged (PR #5), with subsequent pipelines passing (PR #6), and the repository was cleaned of untracked artifacts.

With the core prototype validated and CI green, we are pivoting toward voice/speech-oriented extensions. Specifically, we will implement semantically aware pause interpretation for STS interactions, codify repeatable workflow routines (mixture-of-experts, parallel macro layering), template and score prompts, and add prompt caching and chaining based on contextual relevance. Real-world conversational references (e.g., timestamped segments from public podcasts like Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman) will guide data preparation and evaluation scenarios. All work will be isolated in a feature branch, use fixed seeds for reproducibility, and be documented in a new speech-module document. This extension is designed to be modular so it does not regress existing simulations or CI.

## Current session summary (feat/speech-pause-logic)

- Added annotated podcast datasets: `data/podcasts/lex_musk.json`, `data/podcasts/jre_trump.json`.
- Extended `speech/pause_model.py` to load JSON, learn pause thresholds from label means, and predict labels with thresholding + priors fallback.
- Expanded tests: pause model, macro workflow parallelism/merge, and prompt cache similarity ordering (6 tests passing with plugin autoload disabled).
- Enhanced `routines/engine.py` with example handlers that wire to `workflows/macro.py`.
- Enriched `templates/prompts.json` with pause analysis and follow-up templates.
- Updated `docs/speech-module.md` to document datasets, thresholds, and tests.
